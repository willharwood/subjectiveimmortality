# Subjective Immortality

Under a series of assumptions, some more plausible than others, we argue that while
we, as living beings, are objectively mortal, our conscious or subjective
experience is that of an immortal. Death is not merely akin to a sleep but is
in fact exactly like it.

While superficially similar to the idea of 'Quantum Immortality'[^1], we do not depend
on any many-world effects, and neither do we require the existence of a non-material
soul.

## Continuity of self

We begin with some assumptions on about the nature of subjective experience, in
decreasing order of plausibility:

1. Continuity of time is not necessary for continuity of subjective experience.
> The you who wakes continues the life of the you who fell asleep.
2. Continuity of life is not necessary for continuity of subjective experience.
> Imagine being frozen for a hundred years. If you were revived, your
> subjective experience would resume just as if you had been asleep.
3. Continuity of matter is not necessary for continuity of subjective experience.
> Imagine being frozen, then having your brain duplicated exactly by some
> destructive process, then placed in a new body, and revived. You would
> continue.

## Eternal reality

4. Time will not end, and moreover _change_ will continue forever.

In particular, while the universe may appear to be heading towards a Heat Death,
where everything becomes equally cold and nothing can ever happen, there will
be some force which prevents it, or a new universe will spontaneously appear,
or our universe will instead fall into a Big Crunch and a new Big Bang, and...

## The immortality of subjective experience

Imagine a person who dies in their sleep. At the point of losing consciousness,
their brain is in a certain state -- specifically, that part of their brain
responsible for their conscious experience is in a certain state. Time passes,
trillions of years, and more. Whole universes may come and go, but eventually,
by pure chance, that same pattern will recur in a living being, and that
person's subjective experience will resume. They wake, with no idea that they
had been gone for so long, or gone at all. Suppose this new being dies: the same
thing will, eventually, happen.

> just one thread, which experiences everything?

This follows directly from our assumptions above: that
continuity of matter is not necessary for continuity of subjective experience,
and that time, and change, will never end.
Every past arrangement will,
eventually, recur; every consciousness travels a thread that is infinitely long.

# Scattered thoughts

* To paraphrase the whole argument: _if_ the transporters of Star Trek could,
  in principle, work as advertised;
  and _if_ change never ceases; _then_ we are subjectively immortal.

* Time could _loop_, and cycle infinitely. There is no reason to assume endless
  novelty.

* As an argument against using 'pattern' in so blithe a way we could ask what would
  happen if you died, and then were duplicated _twice_ in two different locations.
  Where would your subjective experience resume?  Could we rely on
  the impossibility of two events happening at exactly the same time?
  Or, and here we arrive at another imaginative difficulty,
  could your experience bifurcate?

* While _objectively_ these are two different beings, _subjectively_
  the conscious experience will flip from one to the other without noticing the
  change (memories, after all, are physical features of the brain).

* When a body dies, does something move? If the subjective experience of being A picks up again in
  being B, is there an _it_ which has _moved_ from one to the other? And if so,
  what extra limitations might that imply? Given that the pattern has reappeared by chance,
  there is no transfer of information, per se...

* There is nothing special about death here. The pattern your brain
  had on some normal Tuesday will recur as well; does that mean that your
  subjective experience could loop back on itself? That it is hopeless to
  think of a single thread at all? 
	    
* Is the idea of Free Will relevant here? No.
  Free Will implies the existence of choices, but one could imagine having a
  subjective experience entirely devoid of choice. Imagine that your existence is
  nothing but an endless cinema. You would still _experience_ it, though never
  be called upon to make a single decision. Imagine that the universe is
  deterministic, and that even the decisions you think you are making where
  truly already determined. You are still experiencing them. (This is circular, as
  we are assuming that Free Will is not a precondition to the possibility of
  subjective experience. But it is difficult to see exactly why that should be,
  what gap is being met. As Hume well knew, _feeling comes before thought._)
  
* How _faithful_ a copy is required has a bearing on whether personal progress
  is possible along this thread.
  Exactly what is the pattern which must recur? Is it an exact duplicate of the
  whole brain, or of some particular sub-structure, or of a mere approximation
  to that structure? Does it need to be similar at all? The answer to this question
  does not affect the overall conclusion, that we are subjectively immortal, but
  does have interesting consequences.
	    
  Imagine that the copy has to be exact. That means whatever progress we made
  in our previous life is picked-up again in our new one. It becomes possible
  to imagine that one could effectively develop across lifetimes.
	    
  Imagine that the copy does not have to be exact -- your brain on waking is
  different to your brain at the point of sleep, after all. Would your next life
  be arbitrary? There would no longer be any possibility of progress, but
  neither would there be a need for an astronomically long time to pass
  before your subjective experience resumes.
	    
  There are practical implications: at one end, if copies need be exact, then
  there is a reason to improve yourself, as that improvement will be carried
  forward into your next life; at the other end, if nothing can be carried
  forward, then there is an imperative to improve the world, as you will
  soon be living in it again.
    
* On continuity of matter.
  This is, in one sense, easier to think about. Call it the _Argument from lack
  of imagination_. 
  If continuity of matter is required, then our subjective experience will die with us.
  This can be accepted, but is impossible to imagine -- we cannot picture what it
  is like to not exist, as to picture something already implies the existence of
  something doing the picturing. If we are subjectively immortal, that problem
  disappears. However long we do not exist for, it does not matter, so long as
  eventually we will exist again. Picturing this is no more difficult than
  picturing the case above of the person frozen for a hundred years.
  That this is easier to imagine is not, of course, an argument for its truth,
  but we can say that this does accord with our experiences. It seems
  tautological or facile to offer as evidence that you really do seem to
  have survived every accident so far, but that is the experience we would
  expect to have, were this argument true.
	
* We can go further. If the flow of time is not a barrier, perhaps there is
  only _one_ conscious entity who, piece by piece, experiences everything, forever.
  A god not of creation, but of experience.
