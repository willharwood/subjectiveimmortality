https://subjectiveimmortality.com sketches the idea that a physicalist, "common-sense" view of the universe contains within it, surprisingly, the implication that we are, in the only way that really matters, immortal. _Subjective_ immortality is the term I use. It is only a sketch though, and too many objections are waved away or not even considered. And the Bundled Dichotomy, which is I think the most interesting (and original!) idea, is placed almost as an after-thought. _This is what books are for_.

## Through-line

* In the materialist "common-sense" view, we exist for a spell, then we die, and that is that. You only live once.
* This is certainly true in an objective sense. No body lives forever. Oblivion?
* What if we consider this materialist, physicalist view more seriously though: we are nothing but atoms.
* An exact enough copy of me _is_ me. If there is no extra-physical stuff, then there is no where for a real difference like consciousness to hide.
* We arrive at a (naive) argument for a sort of immortality. A subjective immortality: you are some pattern, and inevitably that pattern will return.
* There is something Buddhist in this view, of the impossibility of escaping creation. Compare the concept of Anattā, "non-self". We have arrived at it purely through taking physicalism seriously.
* Implicit in the idea of "subjective continuity" is an idea of a self though, we find it very difficult to escape from that.
* There are very good reasons why it _should_ be difficult to do so, we are intelligent so we can plan for the future, a future in which we must believe we still exist. (But it is our germ-line, not us, per se...)
* Link Anattā, Hume, and Parfit, you change one moment to the next, _there is no real continuity_.
* We have a choice now, the bundled dichotomy. Because in one reasonable interpretation oblivion is real, we exist for a moment and that is that. We _are_ that moment of experience. The experience experiences itself, and disappears. Or, if not that, then we are simply _all_ experience. Either one experience, or all of them.
* The tricky argument is here: why not just the experiences of this particular body? Which is where we started. And what we have spent the whole book arguing against.

## Chapters

TODO!

### Introduction

What is subjective immortality? A sketch of the naive proof ("recurring patterns"). A sketch of the Bundled Dichotomy.

### History

Epicurus, Lucretius; de Montaigne; Hume; Parfit.

### Transporter arguments

Following Parfit. Argue that a copy of a person _is_ that person, in all ways, including consciousness.

### Ways to be immortal

...with the point being that _objective_ immortality is a chimerical.

### Consciousness itself

A survey, the various physicalist theories of consciousness. The hard problem (and how every "consciousness explained" book avoids it).

Where is consciousness located? The neurons-in-a-tank thought experiment.

### The far future of the universe

Support the idea that the future is both infinite and infinitely interesting. Boltzmann. Modern physics.

### Bundle-theories of consciousness, against continuity

From Hume to Parfit. Towards the bundled dichotomy. 

### Future work and problems

What _is_ a "moment of consciousness"? How can we reconcile a pattern with a pattern that must change?
