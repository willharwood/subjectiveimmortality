# Book outline

The site https://subjectiveimmortality.com sketches the idea that a physicalist, "common-sense" view of the universe contains within it, surprisingly, the implication that we are in the only way that really matters, immortal. _Subjective_ immortality is the term I use. It is only a sketch though, and too many objections are waved away or not even considered. And the Bundled Dichotomy, which is I think the most interesting (and original!) idea, is placed almost as an after-thought. _This is what books are for_.
