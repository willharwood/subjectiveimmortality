# Lucretius, John Godwin, 2004

Aimed at the general reader. De rerum natura.

Democritus of Abdera (5th century BC), the laughing philosopher. Developed the atomic theory of Leucippus into the first materialistic theory of the universe.

Democritus -> Socrates, Plato, Aristotle -> Epicurus

Epicurus: ataraxia, undisturbed peace.

Epicurus: swerve, even when falling straight down atoms will swerve ever so slightly, and so give the possibility of interacting and creating forms.

_Already_ we have the idea that atoms could eventually re-form and recreate you. Nietzsche takes this up in his Endless Recurrence theory (ewige Wiederkehr).
But Lucretius says there is no link via memory, so it will not be "us" who returns.

Kingsley Amis: the living are simply the dead on holiday.
-> actually, seems to be Maurice Maeterlinck
  Amis did seem to say: "Death has this much to be said for it: You don't have to get out of bed for it. Wherever you happen to be They bring it to you—free."

Not an atheist, gods exist, are made of finer atoms that do not disburse. They are uninterested in us though. Because _were_ they interested, they could not have a life of full tranquility.

Books: first two deal with the atoms, second pair deals with the soul and the mind, the final pair ranges over the cosmos and touches on the wonders of the world and the heavens.

The last century of the Roman republic.

"It seems absurd to have spirits standing ready for the heavenly marriages and births of wild beasts, immortal spirits awaiting mortal frames numberless in mumber struggling hotheadedly among themselves to see which can be the first and strongest to creep in."

# Existence is evidence of immortality, Michael Huemer

Substantially the same as the first part of my thesis? As in, a pattern must recur, if the future is infinite and infinitely interesting.

The idea is how to solve the "two particles flying away from each other, forever" problem. _If_ the past is infinite, then that problem must not occur, otherwise there would be nothing, already, in the present.

# The Inverse Gambler's Fallacy: The Argument from Design. The Anthropic Principle Applied to Wheeler Universes. By Ian Hacking.

Problem: the univere seems fine-tuned for life. Usual solution: well of course it is, or we wouldn't be here to ask the question. There might have been an endless parade of tries at universes which weren't so finely tuned, and now, by chance, one turns up which in which we _can_ exist. And this sequence of universes could have been created randomly, not by some conscious creator god. Rolls of the dice.

Gambler's fallacy: I've rolled the die five times and not rolled a six, therefore the next roll will be a six.
Inverse gambler's fallacy: someone rolls a six. The gambler then _assumes_ that there must have been a number of rolls before, in order to be lucky that one time, just then. But of course the fact that a six was rolled implies no such thing. It could perfectly well have been the first roll of the night, exacly as if a 5 were rolled. Not _predicting_ that a result will be rolled next, rather, an _explanation_ of how a roll could be made.

Is that a real objection to the argument though? True, the fact that the universee _is_ finely tuned does not itself imply that there must have been a succession of previous less finely tuned versions. But that there was that succession does explain it.

Note to follow-up: Hume's Philo, Part VIII of Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, denying the Epicurean hypothesis of endless atoms wandering through endless space and time.
