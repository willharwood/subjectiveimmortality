# Lucretius, John Godwin, 2004

Aimed at the general reader. De rerum natura.

Democritus of Abdera (5th century BC), the laughing philosopher. Developed the atomic theory of Leucippus into the first materialistic theory of the universe.

Democritus -> Socrates, Plato, Aristotle -> Epicurus

Epicurus: ataraxia, undisturbed peace.

Epicurus: swerve, even when falling straight down atoms will swerve ever so slightly, and so give the possibility of interacting and creating forms.

_Already_ we have the idea that atoms could eventually re-form and recreate you. Nietzsche takes this up in his Endless Recurrence theory (ewige Wiederkehr).
But Lucretius says there is no link via memory, so it will not be "us" who returns.

Kingsley Amis: the living are simply the dead on holiday.

Not an atheist, gods exist, are made of finer atoms that do not disburse. They are uninterested in us though. Because _were_ they interested, they could not have a life of full tranquility.

Books: first two deal with the atoms, second pair deals with the soul and the mind, the final pair ranges over the cosmos and touches on the wonders of the world and the heavens.

The last century of the Roman republic.

"It seems absurd to have spirits standing ready for the heavenly marriages and births of wild beasts, immortal spirits awaiting mortal frames numberless in mumber struggling hotheadedly among themselves to see which can be the first and strongest to creep in."

# Existence is evidence of immortality, Michael Huemer

Substantially the same as the first part of my thesis? As in, a pattern must recur, if the future is infinite and infinitely interesting.
