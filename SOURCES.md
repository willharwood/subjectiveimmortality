# Some notes on books and papers, to grow

## Lucretius, John Godwin, 2004

Aimed at the general reader. De rerum natura.

Democritus of Abdera (5th century BC), the laughing philosopher. Developed the atomic theory of Leucippus into the first materialistic theory of the universe.

Democritus -> Socrates, Plato, Aristotle -> Epicurus

Epicurus: ataraxia, undisturbed peace.

Epicurus: swerve, even when falling straight down atoms will swerve ever so slightly, and so give the possibility of interacting and creating forms.

_Already_ we have the idea that atoms could eventually re-form and recreate you. Nietzsche takes this up in his Endless Recurrence theory (ewige Wiederkehr).
But Lucretius says there is no link via memory, so it will not be "us" who returns.

Kingsley Amis: the living are simply the dead on holiday.
-> actually, seems to be Maurice Maeterlinck
  Amis did seem to say: "Death has this much to be said for it: You don't have to get out of bed for it. Wherever you happen to be They bring it to you—free."

Not an atheist, gods exist, are made of finer atoms that do not disburse. They are uninterested in us though. Because _were_ they interested, they could not have a life of full tranquility.

Books: first two deal with the atoms, second pair deals with the soul and the mind, the final pair ranges over the cosmos and touches on the wonders of the world and the heavens.

The last century of the Roman republic.

"It seems absurd to have spirits standing ready for the heavenly marriages and births of wild beasts, immortal spirits awaiting mortal frames numberless in mumber struggling hotheadedly among themselves to see which can be the first and strongest to creep in."

# Existence is evidence of immortality, Michael Huemer

Substantially the same as the first part of my thesis? As in, a pattern must recur, if the future is infinite and infinitely interesting.

The idea is how to solve the "two particles flying away from each other, forever" problem. _If_ the past is infinite, then that problem must not occur, otherwise there would be nothing, already, in the present.

## The Inverse Gambler's Fallacy: The Argument from Design. The Anthropic Principle Applied to Wheeler Universes. By Ian Hacking.

Problem: the univere seems fine-tuned for life. Usual solution: well of course it is, or we wouldn't be here to ask the question. There might have been an endless parade of tries at universes which weren't so finely tuned, and now, by chance, one turns up which in which we _can_ exist. And this sequence of universes could have been created randomly, not by some conscious creator god. Rolls of the dice.

Gambler's fallacy: I've rolled the die five times and not rolled a six, therefore the next roll will be a six.
Inverse gambler's fallacy: someone rolls a six. The gambler then _assumes_ that there must have been a number of rolls before, in order to be lucky that one time, just then. But of course the fact that a six was rolled implies no such thing. It could perfectly well have been the first roll of the night, exacly as if a 5 were rolled. Not _predicting_ that a result will be rolled next, rather, an _explanation_ of how a roll could be made.

Is that a real objection to the argument though? True, the fact that the universee _is_ finely tuned does not itself imply that there must have been a succession of previous less finely tuned versions. But that there was that succession does explain it.

Note to follow-up: Hume's Philo, Part VIII of Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, denying the Epicurean hypothesis of endless atoms wandering through endless space and time.

## Bumps on the Road to Here (from Eternity). By Eric Winsberg.

Boltzmann's suggestion _both_ that the universe as a whole is in thermal equilibrium (heat death), and there really is no direction of time. And that this does not preclude local regions (say, a region the size of the observable universe) experiencing a fluctuation in which entropy will decrease, and an apparent arrow of time will appear. Entropy returning to average _is_ the arrow of time. And all of this continues "forever" (for whatever "forever" means when time is a local and spasmodic phenonenon).

I have some sympathy with this picture of reality.

## Recurrence Theorems: A unified account. By David Wallace

Poincare recurrence theorem.

## The possibility of resurrection. By Peter van Inwagen.

"Mavrodes, as a youth, is identical with Mavrodes, in middle age."

Attempts to argue against a person being re-created in the future is identical with the person in the present, through considering whether Christian bodily resurrection is feasible, even for God.

Generally I think his argument boils down to: look at the atoms in your body now. They are there _because you have lived up until this moment_, that's why this iron atom is at the centre of this haemoglobin protein, this is a whole history and purpose to it. Say in the future God collects the exact atoms of which you were composed and reforms you from them, in the exact positions they were in. Now, you have a person who looks identical, who would feel identical too; yet they are not. Their atoms are not there because of _life_, they are there because they were put there. The puspose is missing.

He uses the analogy of a book penned by Augustine, which is then burned. Even if the atoms of the burned manuscript were collected together and used to create an exact copy of the manuscript, it would still be a copy. The atoms would not be in their positions because Augustine put them there in the process of writing; they would be put there because a scientist put them there. (Albeit, a scientist who put them there _because_ Augustine put them there.)

## Time and personal itentity in Nietzsche's Theory of Eternal Recurrence. By Scott Jenkins

Expressed most clearly in the Gay Science. A demon says: you will repeat your life forever, with no variation. Is your response horror, or delight? "The heaviest weight".

In Ecce Homo, Nietzsche traces eternal recurrence to Heraclitus: an infinitely repeating cycle Heraclitus called The Great Year.

From Zarathustra: "There is a great year of becoming, a monster of a great year, which must, like an hour glass, turn over and over again. All these years are alike in what is greatest and what is smallest."

Nietzsche: the world is a "musical mechanism [that] repeats eternally its tune, which must never be called a melody."

Other ancient sources: Empedocles (c. 494 – c. 434 BC, fl. 444–443 BC; source of the four elements, added love and strife; Lucretius is a fan; comic potential in his death in Mount Etna) postulated cosmic cycles. Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC, almost overlaps with Empedocles): a doctrine of cosmological recurrence.

Arthur Danto: you can't prove empirically    you're in an eternal recurrence, as that would be a way to distinguish it from other recurrences, which is a contradiction. Paul Loeb points out that you coould just make the discovery in _every_ cycle.

## Being No One. By Thomas Metzinger.

Psm phenomenal self model
Pmir phenomenal model of the intentionality relation

Distinct theoretical entities, the conceptual link between first and third person approaches to the conscious mind. 

What makes a nonperson a person is a special sort of psm plus a pmir: having a transparent self model, plus a conscious model of the arrow of intentionality. 

Qualia don't exist

Vehicle/content distinction is useful, dangerously close to Cartesian dualism though. (Me: to think of the “experiencer and the experience” is a trap.)

Bretano, intentionale inexistenz.

Phenomenal content is what stays the same irrespective of whether something is representation or misrepresentation. (If I am mistaken in my subjective experience, I am no less having a subjective experience; we are conscious in dreams). 

## The Repugnant Conclusion, 
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/

On the Repugnant Conclusion: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/

Repugnant Conclusion: start with a population A, each of whose well-being is strong (value = a).
Expand the population to A+. The extra people still have positive well-being, a', though a' < a. I.e. you've added a group of people who're slightly worse off but still not terribly off to your population. Since they all have lives worth living, we would generally say that A+ is better than A: the total amount of good in the world is increased. But consider a population B. This is the same size as A+, and its people are all happier than the less happy people in A, though not quite as happy as the happiest in A. Their happiness b is a < b < a'. Is B preferable to A? I think we might say yes. Here's the problem though: we can move to B+, and then C+, and then D+. At each step, the population gets larger, and less happy, yet we can apply the same argument to say: this is better. By the time we get to Z+ we have a truly enormous population of mostly quite sad people. This is not better.

Total value utilitarianism.

What of average value utilitarianism? It creates the opposite problem. E.g. a world in which there is one person whose life is excellent is better than a world in which there are a billion people whose lives are merely very good. Various more sophisticated systems have been proposed, for example Variable Value, where adding extra lives has exponentially diminishing returns (as a way to stop the A+ to B+ to C+... trick from working). 

Parfit tried to solve this problem, come up with a theory X, in Reasons and Persons. (A theory of beneficence.) He felt that he did not succeed.

A list of approaches to dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion:

1. Average principle
   Problem: the really happy person is better than the billion quite happy people. Also: a world in which one person is experencing extreme suffering forever is better than a world in which a billion people are experiencing only slightly less extreme suffering forever. (And yet I wonder, which is our world?)
2. Variable value principles
   Isn't there a short story about a city where everyone seems happy, yet it's bought at the expense of a child experiencing torment at its centre?
3. Critical level
   Have a welfare level that is good above, bad below.
4. Questioning how welfare can be compared and measured
5. Counting welfare differently depending on temporal or modal features
   E.g. when comparing two situations, it only makes sense to consider the welfare of people who would be in BOTH of the situations. Which typically just means _present_ people.
6. Revising the notion of life worth living
   Schopenhauerian theories: there is _no_ lives for which the good outweighs the bad. Makes the repugnant conclusion vacuously true: we're already there.
7. Rejecting transitivity
   We have a sequence of A+ to B+ to C+ to... Z+, when Z+ being better than A+ by transitivity. Why not deny transitivity?
8. Appeal to other values
   "Justicism", there is a level of wellbeing that each person deserves. Feels similar to the critical level approach?
9. Accept the impossibility of satisfactory population ethics
   We are, aren't we, trying to carve on stone tablets the messy result of evolution of a social species... why should it really be fully consistent and explicable, our intuitions on what is right?
10. Accept the repugnant conclusion

My own thoughts? Second-order effects: a world of a trillion unhappy people is more likely to come to a solution to its unhappiness than a world of one moderately unhappy person (Hah!); all of these arguments are strangely static, as of course my own arguments are.

# Some random arguments

## The experience and the experiencer

*This* is the central conceptual mistake. There are not two entities, any more than we can be separate from that which we are. 

## Two sorts of first-cause

The first cause argument has two versions. One through history, one in the present.

The historical first cause, time t+1 is created by time t. What happened at t=0? (Creator needed at that time; needed no longer after it.)
    What if the past is infinite. How did time ever reach the present..?

The present argument: my hand is supported by my arm, which is supported by my shoulder, my body, the chair, the earth, etc. Doesn't this chain of support require a _current_ first support? Doesn't it, unlike the historical first cause above, require a first-supporter to still exist?
    Gridlock! Da Vinci's self-supporting bridge.
    If the chair were to disappear, my arm would not fall immediately. My body would fall first. There would be a delay.
    If the sun were to disappear no one would notice for over eight minutes.
