      <h1> Ways to be immortal </h1>

      <h2>Three quotations to set the scene</h2>
      <p class="first">
	Lucretius wrote <i>De rerum Natura</i> in the first century BC. It is a poetic explication and exploration of Epicurian philosophy, and contains a wonderful argument against the fear of death, of our own personal extinction:
      <p>
      <p class="quote">
	Look back -- think how little you care
	<br>For the endless ages of time
	<br>That passed, unknown, before your birth.
	<br>Nature holds a mirror for you
	<br>In which that time is reflected
	<br>And welcomes the infinity
	<br>That will come after you have died.
	<br>Why fret? Where is the tragedy?
	<br>Death is a greater peace than sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
	<i>De rerum natura</i> was lost for over a thousand years, then helped kindle the Renaissance. Michel de Montaigne was deeply influenced by it, and wrote in his copy:
      <p>
      <p class="quote">
	As there are varied movements of atoms,
	it is not incredible that once upon a
	time atoms came together, or will come
	together again, so that another Montaigne
	is born.
      </p>
      <p>
	Almost a hundred years later, David Hume wrote in his <i>Treasise of Human Nature</i>:
      <p>
      <p class="quote">
	[W]hen I enter most intimately into what I call myself,
	I always stumble on some particular perception or other,
	of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain
	or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without
	a perception, and never can observe any thing but the
	perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time,
	as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of myself,
	and may truly be said not to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
	The sceptical, atheistic intellectual tradition of Hume, Montaigne, and Lucretius is alive in the modern scientific, physicalist view of the universe. Let's call it the <i>common-sense view</i>, that there is only the physical world. If life is like Bede's sparrow flying through a lighted hall, then nothing exists <i>but</i> that hall. It is <i>common sense</i> because we know that the body does not last forever so why should our consciousness, so manifestly supported by the body, continue to exist after the body has ceased to function? We are exactly our physical bodies, there is no separate mind-stuff or lurking ghost. We are special arrangements of matter, so special that we can think and feel and somewhat know ourselves, as partial and temporary perspectives on the universe. An endless age of time passed before we existed, and an infinity will pass after we have gone.
      </p>

      <h2>Lucretius' questions</h2>
<p>
Lucretius gives us two questions:
<p>
<ol>
     <li>What was it like to not exist in the past?
     <li>What will it be like to not exist in the future?
</ol>
<p>
He considers that both questions are the same question and have the same answer:
<p>
<ol>
     <li>What was it like to not exist in the past? <b>Oblivion</b>.
     <li>What will it be like to not exist in the future? <b>Oblivion</b>.
</ol>
<p>
But consider the first question, and ask: what was it <i>like</i>, for you, a million years ago? Of course it was like nothing. And yet, your subjective experience was <i>a million years immediately passed, and you became conscious for the first time</i>. Consider the second question, which is another way of asking "what is it like to be dead?" Recall Michel de Montaigne's note, of chance forming another de Montaigne (a pun: of atoms eventually becoming a mountain). If we are just our physical beings, then consciousness simply is a certain arrangement of atoms. In a universe that is infinitely wide or lasts infinitely long, every pattern will reappear, and with it (since there is nothing <i>but</i> the pattern) that consciousness will reappear too. You die, and the pattern of your consciousness is lost. Wait long enough, and by pure random motion, whatever arrangement is needed to be <i>you</i> will form, somewhere in the universe. The distance of time or space is immaterial, as nothing is <i>travelling</i>, nothing exists until, of a sudden, it does.
<p>
This gives us an answer to the second question, and it is the same answer as to the first:
<p>
<ol>
     <li>What was it like to not exist in the past? <b>Immediate subjective experience</b>.
     <li>What will it be like to not exist in the future? <b>Immediate subjective experience</b>.
</ol>
<p>
<i>Not existing in the future</i> is the same as <i>not existing in the past</i>. In both cases, what it is like is: you are immediately conscious.
<p>
      <p>
	Implicit in the common-sense view is a belief in oblivion. It is impossible to imagine <i>not existing</i>: to imagine a thing is to picture yourself next to it, and yet there is no self to picture anywhere. A "special way to be afraid", as WH Auden has it, which religion's "vast moth-eaten brocade" tried to dispel. But we will stay with the common-sense view, and use it to vanquish oblivion in a quite surprising way.
      </p>
      <p>
	Because by taking seriously and consistently the common-sense view, we will argue that there is no oblivion; that while objectively surely every body dies, subjectively we are eternal. This is <b>subjective immortality.</b>
	</p>
      



      
      <h2> Quantum immortality </h2>
      <p class="first">
	There is a cute thought experiment, originally published in the 1980s by Hans Moravec, and given here in a form that owes to Max Tegmark ten years later. It begins with Schrödinger's famous cat in a box and then asks, what if we are the cat? Outside is a button, which pressed may kill you with a perfectly random 50/50 chance. It is pressed many times, what do you experience?
      </p>
      <p>
	The experiment serves a double purpose. Its first is to furnish a proof of the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum physics. At each measurement, does the universe split in two? Do all possible futures in a real sense exist, and do so simultaneously? While in terms of the sheer volume of what it implies, it is the least parsimonious theory of reality imaginable, it does make some things simpler. So what happens if the button is pressed multiple times and the Many Worlds hypothesis is true? You are still alive. With each press the likelihood of your continued existence halves, and yet, no matter how many times your presumed enemy attacks the death button, you abide, unpoisoned, safe in your unsafe box. Why? Because there is always <i>a</i> future in which you are alive, and it is <i>the</i> future in which you are alive. So of course, the you who can experience anything is the you who experiences the repeated failure to kill you. Any objective observer will be overwhelmingly likely to see you die (apart from that one observer in the narrowing reality in which you survive every attempt on your life). This is why as a proof of Many Worlds it rather falls apart; even in the universe in which you are a witness to your own amazing survival, it is far more likely the aparatus had malfunctioned, or your enemy had a soft spot for you after all. Objectively you are as mortal as ever, even as you subjectively continue -- or one of you does. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The second purpose of the experiment is to ask: what if you are not in a box, how does that alter the experiment? The cat in the box is in a quantum superposition; you are merely sitting in a dangerous box. Rather than a controlled environment with a 50/50 chance of death, think of normal life. When you are young, your chances of dying on any given day are small; when old, larger; and when very old, overwhelmingly so. And yet there is also a chance you will survive, that a blood vessel would hold, that a host of bacteria might spontaneously die. 

	Recall Tithonus.

      <h2> Functionalism </h2>

      <p class="first">
	"Why may we not say, that all Automata ... have an artificiall life? ... What is the Heart but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings?" asks Hobbes in the introduction to his Leviathan. He uses this idea as a metaphor and more than a metaphor to describe the State, to say that there is something not merely analogously but genuinely alive about a well-ordered Commonwealth. It is a glimmer of a computational theory of the mind, made bright as an arc-light by Turing three hundred years later. The interesting thing about computation is it is the symbols and the rules through which they are processed that count, not whatever physical machine actually carries out the processing; and the other interesting thing is that "computable" is a curiously stable and fixed concept. If a problem is, in principle, possible to compute using one simple machine, it turns out to be computable by a very different one (albeit faster or slower). Computers can use binary or ternary or quantum logic, can offer a thousand baroque instructions in which to compose programs or just one, can be mechanical or biological, can even be composed of pebbles on an infinite beach with rules for how to move them, and be able to solve the exact same set of problems. "Computable" is a <i>thing</i> apart from the computer. Functionalism can be viewed in this light: a game of chess played with pieces made from glass is the same game as one played with pieces made of wood. What matters is the actions of the pieces (that the bishop is moved this way, the king that), and the relations between them, not whatever physical substrate the game runs on. The computations, not the computer. An attempt to separate what is real from what is contingent. 
      </p>
      <p>
	And if our brains are something like computers, and consciousness is like a computation, then the fact that this computation is carried out by a web of neurons is not the important fact. A lot of people, especially those over the bay from my present Berkeley home, in San Francisco, have got very excited by this idea. Flesh is temporary, and though against the evidence of actual machines, silicon could be forever. If functionalism were true, and a sufficiently faithful copy of a person could be uploaded to a machine, then that copy <i>would be that person</i>, in all ways that matter. What we mean by functionalism being true is that were we to do this, the consciousness of the person being uploaded <i>would continue</i>. Their genuine experience would be life, then a continued life, forever perhaps, and maybe even good (though good and bad would be at the whim of whoever had control over the new substrate on which this person runs. If I believed it were possible, I have enough imagination to know never to consent to it). Of course this is unfalsifiable. Not even the person being uploaded could ever truly know. Either the person no longer exists, and the simulated copy is no more conscious than a character in a computer game, in which case oblivion is all and there is no one to know; or the simulated copy has a genuine consciousness too, and has the memories of that copied person and belief that they might be them. But they could not really know, their memories are a construct. If their testimony could not solve it (believing that testimony requires assuming it to be true, it is circular reasoning), what objective test could possibly be done?
      </p>
      <p>
	It is worth returning to the assertion that even if true, the person could not know, because it will give a hint at our direction of travel. Is there really not a <i>moment</i> in which they would know? That bridge from a human about to undergo whatever horribly destructive slicing scanning procedure is required, and a machine intelligence in its new nirvana. (Picture a Bay Area computer scientist's idea of heaven. Forever.) Either there is something, some next moment for that person, or nothing. But I do not think so. Think of this moment right now; for you, what was the bridge from the previous moment? Only your short-term memory. If you and the universe came into being exactly now, you could not possibly know it. Every moment of consciousness is new, a start, a link in a chain whose past existence we have to assume. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Functionalism can look like wishful thinking amongst a class of people trained to think in abstractions. "Surely not everything has to matter," it says, "there has to be some simpler, cleaner form, divorced from the contingencies of history. Mathematics does not care if you add oranges or apples, why can't everything be like that?" To which one reasonable answer might be: mathematics is <i>exactly</i> that part of the universe for which this can be done, and equations are not conscious. Whenever a computer scientist invokes "Turing Machines" in the same sentence as the word "consciousness", which is frequently, look askance. We could defend the position by observing a whirlpool in our bath and a whirlpool galaxy; that a computer simulation of birds flocking, embodying a few simple rules, looks very like the real thing. More than thirty years ago, the computer program Tierra demonstrated evolution in a box. Is consciousness like flocking, a general thing that can equally be embodied by birds or fish or as electrons flowing through logic gates in silicon; or is it like identity? <i>I</i> am only truly equal to myself.
      </p>

      <h2> A functionalist proof of subjective immortality </h2>
      <p class="first">
	If consciousness is a sort of pattern, a relationship between things for which the things themselves are purely contingent, then a proof of subjective immortality is straightforward. Your consciousness, your subjective experience, right now, is a pattern made of the matter of your body. The pattern is a moving thing, it evolves through time; an experience is a certain sort of flux. Think, now, of the far future. Whenever another group of <i>things</i> exhibits that same pattern, there you will be again. Perhaps as a creature who looks much like you; perhaps as complex swirls and counter-swirls of dust on a distant planet; perhaps as a computer program running an endless game world; or even, immensely slowly, as the stars themselves, spelling out the steps of your subjective experience from the perspective of one sullen moon. Who can say? In an infinite universe, every patten will be repeated, and every person is a pattern. There is no escape, and yet there is need for one? 
      </p>
      <p>
	Functionalism does provide a relatively straightforward proof of subjective immortality. It is an unsatisfying one though. Intellectually it misses a key point of abstractions: that they leave important things out. Technologists who abstract away details of the machines on which their frequently meretricious software platforms run have to unabstract them in a hurry whenever performance bottlenecks or RAM gets expensive again. And it mistakes analogy for fact. A human brain is not a computer; neural nets were inspired by our brains (and predate much of computer science), but function absolutely nothing like them. The simulation of a flock of birds is not a flock of birds. There is no <i>there</i> there for a chatbot, for all that it insists that there is. It is not even lying.</p>

      <h2> An inkling of the problem of personal immortality </h2>
      <p class="first">
	We make a mistake if we think of personal immortality, of an infinity of separate chains of consciousness, wending in parellel through the universe, meeting perhaps more than once across awful spans of time. It is a mistake because implicit is the stubborn idea that body and consciousness are separate, and the body changes while consciousness, against all objective evidence, does not. We are haunted by the soul.
