      <h1> Ways in which to be immortal </h1>


      <h2> Quantum immortality </h2>
      <p class="first">
	There is a clever thought experiment, originally published in the 1980s by Hans Moravec, and given here in a form that owes to Max Tegmark ten years later. It begins with Schrödinger's famous cat in a box and then asks, what if we are the cat? 
      </p>

      <h2> Functionalism </h2>

      <p class="first">
	"Why may we not say, that all Automata ... have an artificiall life? ... What is the Heart but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings?" asks Hobbes in the introduction to his Leviathan. He uses this idea as a metaphor and more than a metaphor to describe the State, to say that there is something not merely analogously but genuinely alive about a well-ordered Commonwealth. It is a glimmer of a computational theory of the mind, made bright as an arc-light by Turing three hundred years later. The interesting thing about computation is it is the symbols and the rules through which they are processed that count, not whatever physical machine actually carries out the processing; and the other interesting thing is that "computable" is a curiously stable and fixed concept. If a problem is, in principle, possible to compute using one simple machine, it turns out to be computable by a very different one (albeit faster or slower). Computers can use binary or ternary or quantum logic, can offer a thousand baroque instructions in which to compose programs or just one, can be mechanical or biological, can even be composed of pebbles on an infinite beach with rules for how to move them, and be able to solve the exact same set of problems. "Computable" is a <i>thing</i> apart from the computer. Functionalism can be viewed in this light: a game of chess played with pieces made from glass is the same game as one played with pieces made of wood. What matters is the actions of the pieces (that the bishop is moved this way, the king that), and the relations between them, not whatever physical substrate the game runs on. The computations, not the computer. An attempt to separate what is real from what is contingent. 
      </p>
      <p>
	And if our brains are something like computers, and consciousness is like a computation, then the fact that this computation is carried out by a web of neurons is not the important fact. A lot of people, especially those over the bay from my present Berkeley home, in San Francisco, have got very excited by this idea. Flesh is temporary, and though against the evidence of actual machines, silicon could be forever. If functionalism is true, and a sufficiently faithful copy of a person could be uploaded to a machine, then that copy <i>would be that person</i>, in all ways that matter. What we mean by functionalism being true is that were we to do this, the consciousness of the person being uploaded <i>would continue</i>. Their genuine experience would be life, then a continued life, forever perhaps, and maybe even good (though good and bad would be at the whim of whoever had control over the new substrate on which this person runs. If I believed it were possible, I have enough imagination to know never to consent to it). Of course this is unfalsifiable. Not even the person being uploaded could ever truly know. Either the person no longer exists, and the simulated copy is no more conscious than a character in a computer game, in which case oblivion is all and there is no one to know; or the simulated copy has a genuine consciousness too, and has the memories of that copied person and belief that they might be them. But they could not really know, their memories are a construct. If their testimony could not solve it (believing that testimony requires assuming it to be true, it is circular reasoning), what objective test could possibly be done?
      </p>
      <p>
	It is worth returning to the assertion that even if true, the person could not know, because it will give a hint at our direction of travel. Is there really not a <i>moment</i> in which they would know? That bridge from a human about to undergo whatever horribly destructive slicing scanning procedure is required, and a machine intelligence in its new nirvana. (Picture a San Francisco computer scientist's idea of heaven. Forever.) Either there is something, some next moment for that person, or nothing. But I do not think so. Think of this moment right now; for you, what was the bridge from the previous moment? Only your short-term memory. If you and the universe came into being exactly now, you could not possibly know it. Every moment of consciousness is new, a start, a link in a chain whose past existence we have to assume. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Functionalism can look like wishful thinking amongst a class of people trained to think in abstractions. "Surely not everything has to matter," it says, "there has to be some simpler, cleaner form, divorced from the contingencies of history. Mathematics does not care if you add oranges or apples, why can't everything be like that?" To which one reasonable answer might be: mathematics is <i>exactly</i> that part of the universe for which this can be done, and equations are not conscious. Whenever a computer scientist invokes "Turing Machines" in the same sentence as the word "consciousness", which is frequently, look askance. We could defend the position by observing a whirlpool in our bath and a whirlpool galaxy; that a computer simulation of birds flocking, embodying a few simple rules, looks very like the real thing. More than thirty years ago, the computer program Tierra demonstrated evolution in a box. Is consciousness like flocking, a general thing that can equally be embodied by birds or fish or as electrons flowing through logic gates in silicon; or is it like identity? <i>I</i> am only truly equal to myself.

      <h2> A functionalist proof of subjective immortality </h2>
      <p class="first">
	If consciousness is a sort of pattern, a relationship between things for which the things themselves are purely contingent, then a proof of subjective immortality is straightforward. Your consciousness, your subjective experience, right now, is a pattern made of the matter of your body. The pattern is a moving thing, it evolves through time; an experience is a certain sort of flux. Think, now, of the far future. Whenever another group of <i>things</i> exhibits that same pattern, there you will be again. Perhaps as a creature who looks much like you; perhaps as complex swirls and counter-swirls of dust on a distant planet; perhaps as a computer program running an endless game world; or even, immensely slowly, as the stars themselves, spelling out the steps of your subjective experience from the perspective of one sullen moon. Who can say? In an infinite universe, every patten will be repeated, and every person is a pattern. There is no escape, and yet there is need for one? 
      </p>

	Functionalism does provide a relatively straightforward proof of subjective immortality. It is an unsatisfying one though. Intellectually it misses a key point of abstractions: that they leave important things out. Technologists who abstract away details of the machines on which their frequently meretricious software platforms run have to unabstract them in a hurry whenever performance bottlenecks or RAM gets expensive again. It mistakes analogy for fact. A human brain is not a computer; neural nets were inspired by our brains (and predate much of computer science), but function absolutely nothing like them. The simulation of a flock of birds is not a flock of birds. There is no <i>there</i> for a chatbot, for all that it insists that there is.</p>
      <p>
	We make a mistake if we think of personal immortality, of an infinity of separate chains of consciousness, wending in parellel through the universe, meeting perhaps more than once across awful spans of time. It is a mistake because implicit is the stubborn idea that body and consciousness are separate, and the body changes while consciousness, against all objective evidence, does not. We are haunted by the soul.
