      <h1> Continuities of consciousness </h1>
      
      <div class="abstract">
	The goal is an understanding of the <i>objectively</i> discontinuous nature of subjective experience. We identify three types of discontinuity: of time, life, and of matter. Of the three, the discontinuity of matter is the most difficult to accept. We introduce the terminology of a "subjective line" to explain what might be continuous to a perso while broken to any observer of that person. A major difficulty is the distinction between a gradual turnover or a quick one, understood through Theseus' ship. We present various arguments (including transporter arguments) that <i>if</i> there is such a thing as a subjective line at all, it must be preserved despite the discontinuities of time, life, and matter. (That <i>if</i> is important.) Our initial definition of subjective immortality is that every subjective line is infinitely long. "Continuity" is an interesting word to use, as in the mathematical sense it means <i>unbroken</i>. That is not how it feels to be conscious at all.

	I had surgery on my shoulder to repair an old injury. Twenty years earlier, on a very English summer's day, I took a tumble into one of the dEssay Concerning Human Understandingeep fosses of Maiden Castle, an Iron Age hillfort. Imagine a large flat hill protected by rings of deep ditches. Vespasian and his Second Legion rolled through the warrior aristocracy of the Durotriges there. Now, it is used for grazing, and I remember after that painful fall looking up at a line of sheep, no more concerned at my plight than the flock of little fluffy clouds above them. I like to think this is a more picturesque than average reason to require shoulder stabilization. The surgery took place at a clinic in San Francisco. I waited anxiously, heart rate too high, as the anesthesiologist began the-- it was over. I was sitting in a different room, no sensation on my righthand side, being told by the nurse that the surgery was done. Are you <i>sure</i>? I said. Several hours had disappeared as if excised by a scalpel.

	We exist in time, which can speed and slow and skip. We know this already: a person will experience many more 4 pms than 4 ams. Sleep is not utterly disorientating because we usually wake in the same room as we fall asleep, and that dreams give the impression that we are still travelling continuously through time. Yet we dream for a quarter or less of the time spent asleep, the rest is a sort of oblivion. A person's subjective experience is, objectively, a stuttering thing, and there is in principle no limit to the amount of time that could be lost. What would the subjective experience be of a person who is frozen now, and somehow unfrozen in a thousand years? 
      </p>
      <p>
	The difference between a person's continuous subjective experience, and the many objective discontinuities of that experience is obvious, and profound. A concept we will use to sharpen this distinction is the <i>subjective line</i>: the complete sequence of felt experiences a person has; waking experiences, dreams, every moment in which there is a <i>there</i> there for the person. Each moment on the subjective line is also a moment in which the person is alive, yet the reverse is not true. The subjective line does not include dreamless sleep, or the oblivion of anaesthetic, or (currently fanciful) periods in the deep freeze. When we <i>are</i>, the subjective line <i>is</i>. What makes the universe special is that for certain arrangements of matter, at certain times, an experience exists.

	Imagine a lightbulb, shining bright, then dark, then bright again, blinking on and off. If we snip away all the moments in which the lightbulb is off, we have something equivalent to its subjective line. And in that view the lightbulb is always on until the moment it turns off forever. We are alive whether conscious or not, an unceasing chemistry; but we only really exist in time when having some subjective experience. In moments off the subjective line, we have to assume that something exists: a body, tens of trillions of cells, a hive of activity, a host of feedback loops. You, though, the you that operates just behind the eyes, you only exist on the subjective line.

	This is not a new idea. In A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume writes:
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
	For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call <i>myself</i>, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch <i>myself</i> at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of <i>myself</i>, and may truly be said not to exist.
      </div>
      <p>
	Hume proceeds to describe a person as a <i>bundle</i> of perceptions, an idea we will pursue in more depth in <a href="bundles.html">Chapter 5</a>. For now, our direction is towards an initial, naïve conception of subjective immortality: that every person's subjective line is infinitely long.
      </p>

      <h2> The three discontinuities </h2>

      <p class="first">	
	The first and easiest discontinuity is <i>time</i>. It is easy to believe because it is necessary to believe: that the person who falls asleep is the same person who wakes up. It is our lived experience. In fact, it takes a positive effort not to believe that this is true. Perhaps each morning a new person awakes who merely thinks that they are the continuation of yesterday's person? Perhaps after each conscious moment a new person exists, perhaps every conscious line is a single point? Another way of expressing the same thought: you have this moment, will you have another? Dualistic theories do not have this problem. If there is some separate, unchanging kernel of a person, a soul coincident with yet separate from the changing body, then of course that survives through time. In this book we stick to the materialist view, only matter and its arrangements, so there is no unchanging kernel we can point to. A person is in Heraclitan flux. For now though, let us continue to believe that stretches of time can routinely disappear from our lived experience, and yet we remain ourselves, our subjective line hiding every break. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The second discontinuity is <i>life</i>. Medicine has reached the point where it is almost a commonplace for a person to be clinically dead for a time, then be revived. It is generally accepted that the person who is alive again is the same person who was alive before. (Here it is dualistic theories that have trouble. Does the soul decide to return, or is it forced to?) We can stretch this intuition: think of the person frozen for a thousand years, what is it like for them? Most would agree that their experience would be <i>being alive in the present</i>, and then <i>being alive a thousand years in the future</i>, rather that: <i>being alive in the present</i>, followed by oblivion, then some other person appearing a thousand years later. Should the same be true if the process of freezing had the effect of destroying a person's old memories? I.e. if the revived person does not know that they are on to their second life? We are brushing against a strain of thought that goes back to John Locke and his Memory Theory of personal identity (from the Essay Concerning Human Understanding). Think, though, of the moment-to-moment experience of a person. Why should it matter what they remember? Memory is partial, fallible, constantly renewed and in being renewed, changed. What might count for legal definitions of identity is not interesting. Does a person's subjective line, their chain of experiences, continue if revived from death, and with no arbitrary time limit on when that revival must happen? It seems reasonable to say yes, it does.
      </p>
      <p>
	The third discontinuity is <i>matter</i>. We are made of atoms, not always the same atoms. While it is a huge oversimplificiation to say that cellular replication means that our bodies are completely replaced every seven years, there is some truth to it. Skin cells are fully replaced every couple of years (welcome, dust); skeletal cells take a decade. Brain cells, though, are not replaced. Are they the unchanging core that gives personal continuity? If so, we have to stop here, and admit that matter is not the third discontinity, that the subjective line is broken by changes to the matter of which at least our brains are composed. The task of the following section is to provide plausible arguments why even without brain cells being turned over as quickly as the rest of the body, they do change enough to conclude that the subjective line survives larger changes in matter.

      <h2> What would it look like if the subjective line were broken </h2>
      <p class="first">
	When told that it was rather obvious that people might believe that the sun went around the Earth, because that is what it looks like, Wittgenstein replied: "What would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?" We do not arrive on this Earth a blank piece of paper, we are already a book, filled with assumptions.
