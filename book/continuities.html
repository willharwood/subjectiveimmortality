      <h1> Continuities of consciousness </h1>
      
      <div class="abstract">
	The goal is an understanding of the <i>objectively</i> discontinuous nature of subjective experience. We identify three types of discontinuity: of time, life, and of matter. Of the three, the discontinuity of matter is the most difficult to accept. We introduce the terminology of a "subjective line" to explain what might be continuous to a perso while broken to any observer of that person. A major difficulty is the distinction between a gradual turnover or a quick one, understood through Theseus' ship. We present various arguments (including transporter arguments) that <i>if</i> there is such a thing as a subjective line at all, it must be preserved despite the discontinuities of time, life, and matter. (That <i>if</i> is important.) Our initial definition of subjective immortality is that every subjective line is infinitely long. "Continuity" is an interesting word to use, as in the mathematical sense it means <i>unbroken</i>. That is not how it feels to be conscious at all.

      <h2> Time disappeared </h2>
      <p class="first">
	I had surgery on my shoulder to repair an old injury. Twenty years earlier, on a very English summer's day, I took a tumble into one of the fosses of Maiden Castle, an Iron Age hillfort. Imagine a large flat hill protected by rings of deep ditches. Vespasian and his Second Legion ploughed through the warrior aristocracy of the Durotriges there. In our time it is used for grazing, and I remember after that alarming fall looking up at a line of sheep, no more concerned at my plight than the flock of little fluffy clouds above them. I like to think this is a more picturesque than average reason to require shoulder stabilization. The surgery took place at a clinic in San Francisco. I waited anxiously, heart rate too high, as the anesthesiologist began the-- it was over. I was sitting in a different room, no sensation on my righthand side, being told by the nurse that the surgery was done. Are you <i>sure</i>? I said. Several hours had disappeared as if excised by a scalpel.

	We exist in time, which can speed and slow and skip. We know this already: a person will experience many more 4 pms than 4 ams. Sleep is not utterly disorientating because we usually wake in the same room as we fall asleep, and dreams give the impression that we are travelling continuously through time. Yet we dream for a quarter or less of the time spent asleep, the rest is a sort of oblivion. A person's subjective experience is, objectively, a stuttering thing, and there is in principle no limit to the amount of time that could be lost between. What would the subjective experience be of a person who is frozen now, and somehow unfrozen in a thousand years? 
      </p>
      <p>
	The difference between a person's continuous subjective experience, and the many objective discontinuities of that experience is obvious, and profound. A concept we will use to sharpen this distinction is the <i>subjective line</i>: the complete sequence of felt experiences a person has; waking experiences, dreams, every moment in which there is a <i>there</i> there for the person. Each moment on the subjective line is also a moment in which the person is alive, yet the reverse is not true. The subjective line does not include dreamless sleep, or the oblivion of anaesthetic, or (currently fanciful) periods in the deep freeze. When we <i>are</i>, the subjective line <i>is</i>. What makes the universe special is that for certain arrangements of matter, at certain times, an experience exists.
      </p>
      <p>
	Imagine a lightbulb, shining bright, then dark, then bright again, blinking on and off. If we snip away all the moments in which the lightbulb is off, we have something equivalent to its subjective line. And in that view the lightbulb is always on until the moment it turns off forever. We are alive whether conscious or not, an unceasing chemistry; but we only really exist in time when having some subjective experience. In moments off the subjective line, we have to assume that something exists: a body, tens of trillions of cells, a hive of activity, a host of feedback loops, a world of chemistry. You, though, the you that operates just behind the eyes, you only exist on the subjective line. 
      </p>
      <p>
	This is not a new idea. In A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume writes:
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
	For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call <i>myself</i>, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch <i>myself</i> at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of <i>myself</i>, and may truly be said not to exist.
      </div>
      <p>
	Hume proceeds to describe a person as a <i>bundle</i> of perceptions, an idea we will pursue in more depth in <a href="bundles.html">Chapter 5</a>. For now, our direction is towards an initial, naïve conception of subjective immortality: that every person's subjective line is infinitely long.
      </p>

      <h2> The three discontinuities </h2>

      <p class="first">	
	The first and easiest discontinuity is <i>time</i>. It is easy to believe because it is necessary to believe: that the person who falls asleep is the same person who wakes up. It is our lived experience. In fact, it takes a positive effort not to believe that this is true. Perhaps each morning a new person awakes who merely thinks that they are the continuation of yesterday's person? Perhaps after each conscious moment a new person exists, perhaps every conscious line is a single point? Another way of expressing the same thought: you have this moment, will you have another? Dualistic theories do not have this problem. If there is some separate, unchanging kernel of a person, a soul coincident with yet separate from the changing body, then of course that survives through time. In this book we stick to the materialist view, only matter and its arrangements, so there is no unchanging kernel we can point to. A person is in Heraclitan flux. For now though, let us continue to believe that stretches of time can routinely disappear from our lived experience, and yet we remain ourselves, our subjective line hiding every break. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The second discontinuity is <i>life</i>. Medicine has reached the point where it is almost a commonplace for a person to be clinically dead for a time, then be revived. It is generally accepted that the person who is alive again is the same person who was alive before. (Here it is dualistic theories that have trouble. Does the soul decide to return, or is it forced to?) We can stretch this intuition: think of the person frozen for a thousand years, what is it like for them? Most would agree that their experience would be <i>being alive in the present</i>, and then <i>being alive a thousand years in the future</i>, rather that: <i>being alive in the present</i>, followed by oblivion, then some other person appearing a thousand years later. Should the same be true if the process of freezing had the effect of destroying a person's old memories? I.e. if the revived person does not know that they are on to their second life? We are brushing against a strain of thought that goes back to John Locke and his Memory Theory of personal identity (from the Essay Concerning Human Understanding). Think, though, of the moment-to-moment experience of a person. Why should it matter what they remember? Memory is partial, fallible, constantly renewed and in being renewed, changed. What might count for legal definitions of identity is not interesting. Does a person's subjective line, their chain of experiences, continue if revived from death, and with no arbitrary time limit on when that revival must happen? It seems reasonable to say yes, it does.
      </p>
      <p>
	The third discontinuity is <i>matter</i>. We are made of atoms, not always the same atoms. While it is a huge oversimplificiation to say that cellular replication means that our bodies are completely replaced every seven years, there is some truth to it. Skin cells are fully replaced every couple of years (welcome, dust); skeletal cells take a decade. Brain cells, though, are not replaced. Are they the unchanging core that gives personal continuity? If so, we have to stop here, and admit that matter is not the third discontinity, that the subjective line is broken by changes to the matter of which at least our brains are composed. The task of the following sections is to provide plausible arguments why even without brain cells being turned over as quickly as the rest of the body, they do change enough to conclude that the subjective line survives larger changes in matter.
      </p>

      <h2> Transported to Mars </h2>

      <p class="first">
	The transporters of 1960s Star Trek are a marvellous story-telling technology invented as a cost-saving measure. A shimmering disappearance and reappearance is easier than animating a shuttle landing. Coincidentally, and for similarly contingent reasons, Dr Who's concept of regeneration was invented the following year. Both are useful ideas for clarifying the meaning of personal identity and continuity. The idea of a transporter was famously (within certain circles) used by Derek Parfit in his Reasons and Persons to tease out what we really mean by a person existing through time. Our interest here is in its use for justifying that the subjective line can survive changes in matter.

      </p>
      
      <h2> What would it look like if the subjective line was very short </h2>
      <p class="first">
	When Wittgenstein was told it was rather obvious why people believed that the sun went around the Earth, because it looks like it does, he replied: "What would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?" Presumably, exactly the same. (Or there is a joke to be had in which to <i>look</i> as though the Earth was the one that moved, it would have to be stationary.) We do not arrive on this Earth a blank piece of paper, with complete objectivity. We are already a book, filled with assumptions, ones that are easier or more difficult to overwrite. To try and understand a thing is to fit that thing into your understanding. The Earth moves, most of us can accept that. A human is composed of trillions of cells, more or less working in concert. Subjective experience is real, senses coming together moment-by-moment as a perspective on the world. It is not a fiction, in the sense that the great mystery of how matter can feel could be dismissed by saying, <i>it doesn't really</i>; it does. This moment of experience exists (it is all we can know exists), what of the next one? It is easy to believe, as we have already said, that the subjective line lasts the length of a life. What would it feel like if it did not, if only a moment of experience is had then oblivion, because by the next moment the body has changed? What would it feel like if the subjective line is never more than a moment long. The body sails on, changing, generating more experiences, a constellation of cells and only mostly an individual. It would feel exactly the same. We only ever feel the current feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
	As another way of approaching the same idea, consider a future pleasure or pain. Will you feel it? If you are your body then yes; yet are you your body, is that what it feels like? Does it not feel like your body is a carrier, a vessel, for you? A hand to draw your subjective line.
      </p>
      <p>
	A thought experiment: the repeated experience. Imagine eating a strawberry. Now imagine that through some future wonder an exact copy of you eats a strawberry in exactly the same way. No brain imaging or experiment could tell the two experiences apart, every (physical) aspect is repeated. What would that feel like to you? Would it feel like eating a strawberry only once, or would it feel like eating a strawberry once, and then (with no memory of having had the experience before) of eating a strawberry again? What is the difference, why would it not be <i>you</i> having that extra strawberry, if you are your body, and the body is the same? 
      </p>
      <p>
	One difficulty here is a stubborn slide back to dualism, to the body-as-vessel. There is a good reason why it is so natural or even necessary a belief: intelligence is for planning, it exists to control the future, to keep a collection of cells viable in a way that maximises its replication. A self is created that believes that it, like the body, will exist in the future, that the choices it makes matter for itself, that the body is in service of it, and not the other way around. This would look and feel exactly the same as the situation in which a self is generated whenever it is necessary or convenient, then destroyed.
      </p>

      <h2> Unconscious metamorphoses (the evil zookeeper) </h2>

      <p class="first">
	We are groping towards something fundamental in our thoughts of a <i>self</i>. What do we mean when we say, a person? Is a person that which is conscious, the subjective experience of a body (with all the discontinuities we discuss above); or is a person the body itself, moving smoothly through time? We can start to tease out our real meaning with a thought experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
	Imagine that tonight, after falling asleep, you are taken by an evil zookeeper, drugged to oblivion. The zookeeper then performs a lengthly surgery on your body and brain at the cellular level, splitting here, moving there, rewiring your mind (and repurposing unneeded neurons as other cells), taking great care that at every step you remain alive, until, at last, what the evil zookeeper has created is a living tiger, of exactly your previous mass, composed of exactly your cells. The tiger wakes, and looks around. What would your subjective experience be? Would it be falling asleep, and then waking as a tiger? Or would it be to fall asleep, and never wake?
      </p>
      <p>
	Now imagine a <i>very</i> evil zookeeper, who, rather than carefully shifting your cells, starts by putting you through a blender, rendering you down to atoms, to the carbon and oxygen and nitrogen and... from which he then proceeds to construct a tiger. The tiger then wakes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Finally, imagine a lazy zookeeper, who does not go through all the fantastical trouble of manufacturing a tiger. No, he merely feeds your body to a tiger cub over the course of a week. The tiger cub, whose atoms are your atoms, wakes up. Do you wake up then, too?
      </p>
      <p>
	In the third example, it feels obvious that you have simply died. (Would the subjective experience of a farmed chicken be to exist, fattened quickly amidst its thousands of cousins, and then -- be a well-fed human, going about his day?) In the second, probably so. In the first, what do we think?
      </p>
      <p>
	Variations are easy to spin. What if you were conscious throughout your transformation into a tiger, would that, <i>should that</i> make a difference? Intuitively I would say that would make it easier to believe that yes, your subjective experience would be to become a tiger. Why, though, should this continuity of consciousness matter? What if, instead of being transformed into a tiger, you were transformed into another person? Would there come a point, say 51% the way through, at which <i>you</i> would disappear and the other person would appear? [TODO: ref to Parfit thought experiment] 
      </p>
      
      
      <h2> Functionalism </h2>
      <p class="first">
	"Why may we not say, that all Automata ... have an artificiall life? ... What is the Heart but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings?" asks Hobbes in the introduction to his Leviathan. He uses this idea as more than a metaphor to describe the State, to say that there is something not merely analogously but genuinely alive about a well-ordered Commonwealth. It is a glimmer of a computational theory of the mind, made bright as an arc-light by Turing three hundred years later. The interesting thing about computation is it is the symbols and the rules through which they are processed that counts, not whatever physical machine actually carries out the processing; and the other interesting thing is that "computable" is a curiously stable and fixed concept. If a problem is, in principle, possible to compute using one simple machine, it turns out to be computable by a very different one (albeit faster or slower). Computers can use binary or ternary or quantum logic, can have a thousand instructions or just one, can be mechanical or biological, can even be composed of pebbles on an infinite beach with rules for how to move them, and be able to solve the exact same set of problems. "Computable" is a <i>thing</i> apart from the computer. Functionalism can be viewed in this light: a game of chess played with pieces made from glass is the same game as one played with pieces made of wood. What matters is the actions of the pieces (that the bishop is moved this way, the king that), and the relations between them, not whatever physical substrate the game runs on. The computations, not the computer. An attempt to separate what is real from what is contingent. 
      </p>
      <p>
	And if our brains are something like computers, and consciousness is like a computation, then the fact that this computation is carried out by a web of neurons is not the important fact. A lot of people, especially those over the bay from my present Berkeley home, in San Francisco, have got very excited by this idea. Flesh is temporary, and though against all the evidence of actual machines, silicon could be forever. If functionalism is true, and a sufficiently faithful copy of a person could be uploaded to a machine, destroying them in the process, then that copy <i>would be that person</i>, in all ways that matter. What we mean by functionalism being true is that were we to do this, the subjective line of the person being uploaded <i>would continue</i>. Their genuine experience would be life, then a continued life, forever perhaps, and maybe even good (though good and bad would be at the whim of whoever had control over the new substrate on which this person runs. If I believed it were possible, I have enough imagination to know never to consent to it). Of course this is unfalsifiable. Not even the person being uploaded could ever truly know. Either the person no longer exists, and the simulated copy is no more conscious than a character in a computer game, in which case oblivion is all and there is no one to know; or the simulated copy has a genuine consciousness too, and has the memories of that copied person and belief that they might be them. But they could not really know, their memories are a construct. If their testimony could not solve it (believing that testimony requires assuming it to be true, it is circular reasoning), what objective test could possibly be done?
      </p>
      <p>
	It is worth returning to the assertion that even if true, the person could not know, because it will give a hint at our direction of travel. Is there really not a <i>moment</i> in which they would know? That bridge from a human about to undergo whatever horrible scanning procedure is required, and a machine intelligence in its new nirvana. (Picture a San Francisco tech-bro's idea of heaven. Forever.) Either there is something, some next moment for that person, or nothing. I do not think so; we return to the question of whether the subjective line need exist at all, even before death and digital resurrection. Think of this moment right now, for you, what was the bridge from the previous moment? Only your short-term memory. If you and the universe came into being <i>right now</i>, you could not possibly know it. Every moment of consciousness is new, a start, a link in a chain whose existence we have to assume. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Functionalism can look like wishful thinking amongst a class of people trained to think in abstractions. "Surely not everything has to matter," it says, "there has to be some simpler, cleaner form, divorced from the contingencies of history. Mathematics does not care if you add oranges or apples, why can't everything be like that?" To which one reasonable answer might be: mathematics is <i>exactly</i> that part of the universe for which this can be done, and equations are not conscious. Whenever a computer scientist invokes "Turing Machines" in the same sentence as the word "consciousness", which is frequently, look askance. We could defend the position by observing a whirlpool in our bath and a whirlpool galaxy; that a computer simulation of birds flocking, embodying a few simple rules, looks very like the real thing; that more than thirty years ago, the computer program Tierra demonstrated evolution in a box. Is consciousness like flocking, a general thing that can equally be embodied by birds or fish or as electrons flowing through logic gates in silicon; or is it like identity? <i>I</i> am only truly equal to myself.
      </p>
      <p>
	
      </p>



	
	We did sneak one assertion through, that functionalism might not, in the strongest sense, be true, and yet a computer program might still be conscious. Many formulations of 

I am making one subtle point here: that functionalism might not, in the strongest sense, be true, and yet a computer program might still be conscious.	
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Another way to express what functionalism means is to say that a sufficiently accurate simulation of a thing <i>is</i> that thing. (Is this true? For example, does a copy count as a simulation...)
