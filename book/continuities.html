      <h1> Continuities of consciousness </h1>
      
      <div class="abstract">
	The goal is an understanding of the <i>objectively</i> discontinuous nature of subjective experience. We identify three types of discontinuity: of time, life, and of matter. Of the three, the discontinuity of matter is the most difficult to accept, and for which we offer a couple of thought experiments (Transported to Mars). We introduce the terminology of a "subjective line" to explain what might be continuous to a person while broken to any observer of that person.

	A major difficulty is the distinction between a gradual turnover or a quick one, understood through Theseus' ship. We present various arguments (including transporter arguments) that <i>if</i> there is such a thing as a subjective line at all, it must be preserved despite the discontinuities of time, life, and matter. (That <i>if</i> is important.) Our initial definition of subjective immortality is that every subjective line is infinitely long. "Continuity" is an interesting word to use, as in the mathematical sense it means <i>unbroken</i>. That is not how it feels to be conscious at all.

	QUESTION: Should this be the first chapter?

      <h2> Time disappeared </h2>
      <p class="first">
	I had surgery on my shoulder to repair an old injury. Twenty years earlier, on a very English summer's day, I took a tumble into one of the fosses of Maiden Castle, an Iron Age hillfort. Imagine a large flat hill protected by rings of deep ditches. Vespasian and his Second Legion ploughed through the warrior aristocracy of the Durotriges there. In our time it is used for grazing, and I remember after that alarming fall looking up at a line of sheep, no more concerned at my plight than the flock of little fluffy clouds above them. I like to think this is a more picturesque than average reason to require shoulder stabilization. The surgery took place at a clinic in San Francisco. I waited anxiously, heart rate too high, as the anesthesiologist began the-- it was over. I was sitting in a different room, no sensation on my righthand side, being told by the nurse that the surgery was over and I was ready to be taken home. Are you <i>sure</i>? I said. Several hours had disappeared as if excised by a scalpel.

	We exist in time, which can speed and slow and skip. We know this already: a person will experience many more 4 pms than 4 ams. Sleep is not utterly disorientating because we usually wake in the same room as we fall asleep, and dreams give the impression that we are travelling continuously through time. Yet we dream for a quarter or less of the time spent asleep, the rest is a sort of oblivion. A person's subjective experience is, objectively, a stuttering thing, and there is in principle no limit to the amount of time that could be lost between. What would the subjective experience be of a person who is frozen now, and somehow unfrozen in a thousand years? 
      </p>
      <p>
	The difference between a person's continuous subjective experience, and the many objective discontinuities of that experience is obvious, and profound. A concept we will use to sharpen this distinction is the <i>subjective line</i>: the complete sequence of felt experiences a person has; waking experiences, dreams, every moment in which there is a <i>there</i> there for the person. Each moment on the subjective line is also a moment in which the person is alive, yet the reverse is not true. The subjective line does not include dreamless sleep, or the oblivion of anaesthetic, or (currently fanciful) periods in the deep freeze. When we <i>are</i>, the subjective line <i>is</i>. What makes the universe special is that for certain arrangements of matter, at certain times, an experience exists.
      </p>
      <p>
	Imagine a lightbulb, shining bright, then dark, then bright again, blinking on and off. If we snip away all the moments in which the lightbulb is off, we have something equivalent to its subjective line. And in that view the lightbulb is always on until the moment it turns off forever. We are alive whether conscious or not, an unceasing chemistry; but we only really exist in time when having some subjective experience. In moments off the subjective line, we have to assume that something exists: a body, tens of trillions of cells, a hive of activity, a host of feedback loops, a world of chemistry. You, though, the you that operates just behind the eyes, you only exist on the subjective line. 
      </p>
      <p>
	This is not a new idea. In A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume writes:
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
	For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call <i>myself</i>, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch <i>myself</i> at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of <i>myself</i>, and may truly be said not to exist.
      </div>
      <p>
	Hume proceeds to describe a person as a <i>bundle</i> of perceptions, an idea we will pursue in more depth in <a href="bundles.html">Chapter 5</a>. For now, our direction is towards an initial, naïve conception of subjective immortality: that every person's subjective line is infinitely long.
      </p>

      <h2> The three discontinuities </h2>

      <p class="first">	
	The first and easiest discontinuity is <i>time</i>. It is easy to believe because it is necessary to believe: that the person who falls asleep is the same person who wakes up. It is our lived experience. In fact, it takes a positive effort not to believe that this is true. Perhaps each morning a new person awakes who merely thinks that they are the continuation of yesterday's person? Perhaps after each conscious moment a new person exists, perhaps every subjective line is a single point? Another way of expressing the same thought: you have this moment, will you have another? Dualistic theories do not have this problem. If there is some separate, unchanging kernel of a person, a soul coincident with yet separate from the changing body, then of course that survives through time. In this book we stick to the materialist view, only matter and its arrangements, so there is no unchanging kernel we can point to. A person is in Heraclitan flux. For now though, let us continue to believe that stretches of time can routinely disappear from our lived experience, and yet we remain ourselves, our subjective line hiding every break. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The second discontinuity is <i>life</i>. Medicine has reached the point where it is almost a commonplace for a person to be clinically dead for a time, then be revived. It is generally accepted that the person who is alive again is the same person who was alive before. (Here it is dualistic theories that have trouble. Does the soul decide to return, or is it forced to?) We can stretch this intuition: think of the person frozen for a thousand years, what is it like for them? Most would agree that their experience would be <i>being alive in the present</i>, and then <i>being alive a thousand years in the future</i>, rather that: <i>being alive in the present</i>, followed by oblivion, then some other person appearing a thousand years later. Should the same be true if the process of freezing had the effect of destroying a person's old memories? I.e. if the revived person does not know that they are on to their second life? We are brushing against a strain of thought that goes back to John Locke and his Memory Theory of personal identity (from the Essay Concerning Human Understanding). Think, though, of the moment-to-moment experience of a person. Why should it matter what they remember? Memory is partial, fallible, constantly renewed and in being renewed, changed. What might count for legal definitions of identity is not interesting. Does a person's subjective line, their chain of experiences, continue if revived from death, and with no arbitrary time limit on when that revival must happen? It seems reasonable to say yes, it does.
      </p>
      <p>
	The third discontinuity is <i>matter</i>. We are made of atoms, not always the same atoms. While it is a huge oversimplificiation to say that cellular replication means that our bodies are completely replaced every seven years, there is some truth to it. Skin cells are fully replaced every couple of years (welcome, dust); skeletal cells take a decade. Brain cells, though, are not replaced. Are they the unchanging core that gives personal continuity? If so, we have to stop here, and admit that matter is not the third discontinity, that the subjective line is broken by changes to the matter of which at least our brains are composed. The task of the following sections is to provide plausible arguments why even without brain cells being turned over as quickly as the rest of the body, they do change enough to conclude that the subjective line survives larger changes in matter.
      </p>

      <h2> Transported to Mars </h2>

      <p class="first">
	The transporters of 1960s Star Trek are a marvellous story-telling technology invented as a cost-saving measure. A shimmering disappearance and reappearance is easier than animating a shuttle landing. Coincidentally, and for similarly contingent reasons, Dr Who's concept of regeneration was invented the following year. Both are useful ideas for clarifying the meaning of personal identity and continuity. The idea of a transporter was famously (within certain circles) used by Derek Parfit in his Reasons and Persons to tease out what we really mean by a person existing through time. Our interest here is in its use for justifying that the subjective line can survive changes in matter, for which we provide a new version of the thought experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
	Consider a person on Earth. They wish to get to Mars (who can say why? It is an awful place, nevertheless), and have two options for doing so. One is to shlep their way over in a spaceship, the other is to be transported directly there: to be scanned, turned to a beam of information, then reconstituted on Mars. Imagine that as a way of lessening the disorientation of suddenly appearing 200 million kilometres away, the transporter company offers an option whereby your new brain is recreated with additional memories of having taken a spaceship there. In this way, whether the person chooses to take a spaceship or the transporter, whether they choose to be bodily carried to Mars, or be destructively encoded into signals that are captured on Mars and used to recreate him, in either case they would arrive on Mars in the same state. In fact we can push this a bit and say that in both cases, spaceship or transporter, the resulting person on Mars is identical, there is no physical difference between each option. 
      </p>
      <p>
	There <i>is</i> a difference of course. While in the spaceship option, the person is made of largely the same atoms on arriving on Mars as they were on Earth; in the transporter option, every atom has changed. It is not their <i>matter</i> which has travelled to Mars, it is a complete description of how to make them <i>from</i> matter. Our assumption is that the transporter is so faithful that there is no physical way to tell the transported version from the non-transported one. (We are verging on the "one-electron universe" idea of John Wheeler. That the reason why all electrons appear to be identical is that they are the same electron zipping forwards in time as an electron, then backwards as a positron. But we do not have to go that far, it should suffice for now to say: physically indistinguishable, rather than identical.)
      </p>
      <p>
	We have two situations: in the first, a person has been taken, bodily, to Mars. It is easy to believe that their subjective line is unbroken. What, really, is the difference between being on a spaceship and sitting at home? If you are still you tomorrow, then you will still be you on Mars, albeit colder, darker, lighter. In the second situation this is much less clear. The person will certainly believe that they are the continuation of that person on Earth, they will have a psychological connection; anyone who meets them would attest that yes, this is the person they remember. But they were destroyed. The person on Mars has not a single atom in common with the person on Earth. (We will save considerations like, what happens if <i>two</i> copies were made on Mars, for later.) What do things look like from the perspective of the subjective line?
      </p>
      <p>
	Either, the subjective line stops at the transporter, and a new subjective line is created on Mars; or, the same subjective line continues on Mars. Either the true subjective experience of the person is: life on Earth, then oblivion. Or life on Earth, then life on Mars. Imagine now that the first case is true. The subjective line <i>is</i> broken by a complete change in matter, to be transported is to be killed, and the newly reconstituted person is, genuinely, a new consciousness. What can we say about that?
      </p>
      <p>
	We can say that the two versions of the person (spaceship and transporter) are physically identical (since that is what the transporter has done, we can safely assume this), but also differ in a single respect: one is the continuation of the subjective experience of a person on Earth, the other is not. The question is: where is this difference kept? We are religiously sticking to a materialist, physicalist viewpoint, remember. <i>If</i> there is a difference, it must be a <i>physical</i> difference. We have already ruled that out though. To underline what we have done here: by assuming that there is no supernatural non-physical component to consciousness, we have to conclude that transportation, the wholesale change of matter in which a person is composed, does not break the subjective line. Matter is our third discontinuity. 
      </p>

      <h2> A brief tangent on philosphical zombies </h2>

      <p class="first">
	An idea most associated with David Chalmers, who also coined the Hard problem of consciousness (of which, more soon), is the philosphical zombie. Imagine a person who has all the normal reactions of someone who is conscious, right down to every known neural correlate of consciousness (also, more later). And imagine that this person is not conscious, that there is no <i>there</i> for him, no actual feeling being had, just the appearance of it. Is that easy to imagine? If so, it suggests that there is something extra-physical about consciousness, something supernatural. In this book, we assume and will continue to assume physicalism, what does this mean for the philosphical zombie? It must be impossible. It implies that there could exist two people, identical in every physical way, yet one is conscious, the other is not. But, as with our people sent by spaceship or transporter, <i>if</i> there is a real difference, there must be a physical difference to capture it. 
      </p>
      <p>
	To explain by analogy, two identical books must tell the same story. If one is a meditation on love and memory, while the other is a book of vegan recipes, some of the words really do have to differ. (An interesting thought, in what way might two identical books tell different stories? If they are read by different people. Subjective experience is intrinsic though, it does not depend on an external observer, it is no one's interpretation but the experience itself.)
      </p>
      
      <h2> What would it look like if the subjective line was very short </h2>
      <p class="first">
	When Wittgenstein was told it was rather obvious why people believed that the sun went around the Earth, because it looks like it does, he replied: "What would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?" Presumably, exactly the same. (Or there is a joke to be had in which to <i>look</i> as though the Earth was the one that moved, it would have to be stationary.) We do not arrive on this Earth a blank piece of paper, with complete objectivity. We are already a book, filled with assumptions, ones that are easier or more difficult to overwrite. To try and understand a thing is to fit that thing into your understanding. It is when that thing is too awkward or strange to possibly fit that you are forced to cut or sand or grow your understanding. The Earth moves, most of us can accept that. A human is composed of trillions of cells, more or less working in concert. Subjective experience is real, senses coming together moment-by-moment as a perspective on the world. It is not a fiction, in the sense that the great mystery of how matter can feel could be dismissed by saying, <i>it doesn't really</i>; it does. This moment of experience exists (it is all we can know exists), what of the next one? It is easy to believe, as we have already said, that the subjective line lasts the length of a life. What would it feel like if it did not, if only a moment of experience is had then oblivion, because by the next moment the body has changed? What would it feel like if the subjective line is never more than a moment long. The body sails on, changing, generating more experiences, a constellation of cells and only mostly an individual. It would feel exactly the same. We only ever feel the current feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
	As another way of approaching the same idea, consider a future pleasure or pain. Will you feel it? If you are your body then yes; yet are you your body, is that what it feels like? Does it not feel like your body is a carrier, a vessel, for you? A hand to draw your subjective line.
      </p>
      <p>
	A thought experiment: the repeated experience. Imagine eating a strawberry. Now imagine that through some future wonder an exact copy of you eats a strawberry in exactly the same way. No brain imaging or experiment could tell the two experiences apart, every (physical) aspect is repeated. What would that feel like to you? Would it feel like eating a strawberry only once, or would it feel like eating a strawberry once, and then (with no memory of having had the experience before) of eating a strawberry again? What is the difference, why would it not be <i>you</i> having that extra strawberry, if you are your body, and the body is the same? 
      </p>
      <p>
	One difficulty here is a stubborn slide back to dualism, to the body-as-vessel. There is a good reason why it is so natural or even necessary a belief: intelligence is for planning, it exists to control the future, to keep a collection of cells viable in a way that maximises its replication. A self is created that believes that it, like the body, will exist in the future, that the choices it makes matter for itself, that the body is in service of it, and not the other way around. This would look and feel exactly the same as the situation in which a self is generated whenever it is necessary or convenient, then destroyed.
      </p>

      <h2> Unconscious metamorphoses (the evil zookeeper) </h2>

      <p class="first">
	We are groping towards something fundamental in our thoughts of a <i>self</i>. What do we mean when we say, a person? Is a person that which is conscious, the subjective experience of a body (with all the discontinuities we discuss above); or is a person the body itself, moving smoothly through time? We can start to tease out our real meaning with a thought experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
	Imagine that tonight, after falling asleep, you are taken by an evil zookeeper, drugged to oblivion. The zookeeper then performs a lengthly surgery on your body and brain at the cellular level, splitting here, moving there, rewiring your mind (and repurposing unneeded neurons as other cells), taking great care that at every step you remain alive, until, at last, what the evil zookeeper has created is a living tiger, of exactly your previous mass, composed of exactly your cells. The tiger wakes, and looks around. What would your subjective experience be? Would it be falling asleep, and then waking as a tiger? Or would it be to fall asleep, and never wake?
      </p>
      <p>
	Now imagine a <i>very</i> evil zookeeper, who, rather than carefully shifting your cells, starts by putting you through a blender, rendering you down to atoms, to the carbon and oxygen and nitrogen and... from which he then proceeds to construct a tiger. The tiger then wakes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Finally, imagine a lazy zookeeper, who does not go through all the fantastical trouble of manufacturing a tiger. No, he merely feeds your body to a tiger cub over the course of a week. The tiger cub, whose atoms are your atoms, wakes up. Do you wake up then, too?
      </p>
      <p>
	In the third example, it feels obvious that you have simply died. (Would the subjective experience of a farmed chicken be to exist, fattened quickly amidst its thousands of cousins, and then -- be a well-fed human, going about his day?) In the second, probably so. In the first, what do we think?
      </p>
      <p>
	Variations are easy to spin. What if you were conscious throughout your transformation into a tiger, would that, <i>should that</i> make a difference? Intuitively I would say that would make it easier to believe that yes, your subjective experience would be to become a tiger. Why, though, should this continuity of consciousness matter? What if, instead of being transformed into a tiger, you were transformed into another person? Would there come a point, say 51% the way through, at which <i>you</i> would disappear and the other person would appear? [TODO: ref to Parfit thought experiment] 
      </p>
      <p>
	These are thoughts in search of a <i>further fact</i>: that we must believe in a personal continuity, and yet it is never where we look for it. Parfit argued against its existence, and used that as an ethical tool. You are no less connected to the person sitting next to you than you are to your own future self, so treat that person better. Of course, it is easy to treat our future selves poorly.
      </p>


      <h2> Transported to Mars times two (and divided by two) </h2>

      <p class="first">
	What if two copies were made? What would the subjective experience be of a person on Earth, who is destructively scanned by a transporter, beamed to Mars, and then reconstructed as <i>two</i> identical persons? Would they have a manner of dual consciousness? Imagine that they are reconstructed on Mars in different rooms, one painted red, the other painted blue. Would the subjective experience of the person be: to exist on Earth, to step inside the transporter, and then to appear in a red room, or in a blue room? 
      </p>
      <p>
	One option we should discount is that their <i>experience</i> is somehow of being in both red and blue rooms. Experience comes through the senses, and there are two quite separate sets of senses involved, one which only knows of a red room, the other, of a blue room. There is no purple option. But then, which is it? We cannot conclude that it is red without equally concluding blue. We are left with the idea that a subjective line can <i>branch</i>. What would it feel like to the person? Of being in a red room, and only knowing that. And also of being in a blue room, and only knowing that. We are approaching something, a way to get beyond a linear, intuitive, sane (one might say) idea of subjective experience, one tied to a particular body and the single path that body takes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Our person has become two people, each with their own subjective experience, and both being the continuation of that person's subjective line. This is awkward and so perhaps the transporter has some protections in place against it. In the event that two identical people are created, the transporter re-scans both, creating two identical corpuses of data, which it then deduplicates (since data are data), and sends back to Earth as a single beam, reconstituted as a single person again. One subjective line became two, and now converges to one again.  
      </p>
      <p>
	We could ask: so what does this single person remember, once back on Earth, a red room or a blue room? That would be a mistake. At the point that one copy is standing in a red room and the other a blue room, they are no longer identical: to perceive is to change. Their re-integration would only work if, say, they had their eyes closed; or if some judicious memory surgery were done so both believed they had been in a purple room. In this way, <i>joining</i> subjective lines does not seem to have the same conceptual problem as splitting them does, of the difficulty of imagining what it could possibly feel like. When the line splits into the future, you have to ask: which future will I be in? When two lines re-join, there is no choice, no question of what is being experienced as there is only one experience to be had.
      </p>
      
      <h2> The Vertiginous Question </h2>

      <p class="first">
	I remember puzzling as a child over the problem of why I was me, and not someone else. At times I was afraid that by looking at someone I would somehow swap with them, and then not know how to behave. Later, not immediately, I realised that I would know how to behave as them, as I would be them, with whatever skills and experience they had. (Perhaps part of my concern was the reflected worry that I did not know, myself, how to behave. I did not want to become someone who knew themselves even less -- imagine.) Later still, I concluded that the problem was a non-problem. I was me because there existed a being with certain properties, who had his own thoughts, and I was the thoughts. I was that which I was, as someone else was that which he was. It was not that I could not swap with another person, so much as there would not be a feeling associated with the swap. I could be everyone, feel everything, and never experience that fact, never know the totality because all experiences are just one experience at a time. These thoughts from decades ago have some relevance for whether the subjective line, personal continuity, exists.
      </p>
      <p>
	And of course the problem has a name, albeit one coined years after the child me worried away at it: the Vertiginous Question. Say there are two people in the world, both alive and conscious. One sits in a red room, and the other sits in a blue room. One says: "I am experiencing red." The other says: "I am experiencing blue."
      </p>
      <p>
	"Why," the first asks, "am I experiencing red?" Because you are in a red room. "But why could I not be the person sitting in a blue room?" Because <i>a</i> person is in a red room, their brain is processing that fact, there is an experience associated with that. "So," the person in the red room says, "you are saying that <i>I</i> am the person in a red room <i>because</i> I am experiencing the colour red? Why do you think that answers my question?" 
      </p>
      <p>
	It is the same confusion: the question is a real one <i>if</i> there is some way of separating the seat of experience, the subjective view, the <i>feeler</i> of the feeling, the <i>experiencer</i> of the experience; of separating <i>that</i> from the physical system underlying it. There is a red room, a person, a brain, a <i>self</i> experiencing the colour red. It is too easy to think of that last part, the experienc<i>er</i> as being moveable. That it is somehow arbitrary that that self happens to be associated with the body in the red room and not the one in the blue room. But there is no separate entity, there is just the physical, atoms in flux. 
      </p>

      
      <h2> The neural correlates of consciousness </h2>

      <h2> The Hard and Easy problems of consciousness </h2>
      <p class="first">
	How to explain subjective experience? That for a lump of matter there is a <i>there</i> there, a window on the universe. It is easier to explain how a very large neural net can process data, or how nerves transmit signals, or how this or that behaviour should evolve; or why being able to build a model of other creatures is efficacious for hunting or mating with them; and how that model could then be turned inwards (eureka!). It is easier to consider that the brain is a computer and that is how it can achieve this or that. But computers do not have subjective experience. All of this is answering the Easy problem of how a creature, including human creatures, can behave as it does. A complete solution to the Easy problem would explain everything about other people, except for the one important thing. That when they say they feel something, a real feeling is being had, and nothing else in the universe matters.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
	
	We did sneak one assertion through, that functionalism might not, in the strongest sense, be true, and yet a computer program might still be conscious. Many formulations of 

I am making one subtle point here: that functionalism might not, in the strongest sense, be true, and yet a computer program might still be conscious.	
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Another way to express what functionalism means is to say that a sufficiently accurate simulation of a thing <i>is</i> that thing. (Is this true? For example, does a copy count as a simulation...)
