    <h1> Continuities of consciousness </h1>

    <div class="abstract">
      The goal is an understanding of the <i>objectively</i> discontinuous nature of subjective experience. We identify three types of discontinuity: of time, life, and of matter. Of the three, the discontinuity of matter is the most difficult to accept. We introduce the terminology of a "subjective line" to explain what might be continuous to a perso while broken to any observer of that person. We present various arguments (including transporter arguments) that <i>if</i> there is such a thing as a subjective line at all, it must be preserved despite the discontinuities of time, life, and matter. (That <i>if</i> is important.) Our initial definition of subjective immortality is that every subjective line is infinitely long. "Continuity" is an interesting word to use, as in the mathematical sense it means <i>unbroken</i>. That is not how it feels to be conscious at all.

    <h2> Time disappeared </h2>
    <p class="first">
      I had surgery on my shoulder to repair an old injury. Twenty years earlier, on a very English summer's day, I took a tumble into one of the deep fosses of Maiden Castle, an Iron Age hillfort. Imagine a large flat hill protected by rings of deep ditches. Vespasian and his Second Legion rolled through the warrior aristocracy of the Durotriges there. Now, it is used for grazing, and I remember after that painful fall looking up at a line of sheep, no more concerned at my plight than the flock of little fluffy clouds above them. I like to think this is a more picturesque than average reason to require shoulder stabilization. The surgery took place at a clinic in San Francisco. I waited anxiously, heart rate too high, as the anesthesiologist began the-- it was over. I was sitting in a different room, no sensation on my righthand side, being told by the nurse that the surgery was done. Are you <i>sure</i>? I said. Several hours had disappeared as if excised by a scalpel.

      We exist in time, which can speed and slow and skip. We know this already: a person will experience many more 4 pms than 4 ams. Sleep is not utterly disorientating because we usually wake in the same room as we fall asleep, and that dreams give the impression that we are still travelling continuously through time. Yet we dream for a quarter or less of the time spent asleep, the rest is a sort of oblivion. A person's subjective experience is, objectively, a stuttering thing, and there is in principle no limit to the amount of time that could be lost. What would the subjective experience be of a person who is frozen now, and somehow unfrozen in a thousand years?

      The difference between a person's continuous subjective experience, and the many objective discontinuities of that experience, is obvious, and profound.
