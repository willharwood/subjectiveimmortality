    <h1> Continuities of consciousness </h1>

    <div class="abstract">
      The goal is an understanding of the <i>objectively</i> discontinuous nature of subjective experience. We identify three types of discontinuity: of time, life, and of matter. Of the three, the discontinuity of matter is the most difficult to accept. We introduce the terminology of a "subjective line" to explain what might be continuous to a perso while broken to any observer of that person. We present various arguments (including transporter arguments) that <i>if</i> there is such a thing as a subjective line at all, it must be preserved despite the discontinuities of time, life, and matter. (That <i>if</i> is important.) Our initial definition of subjective immortality is that every subjective line is infinitely long. "Continuity" is an interesting word to use, as in the mathematical sense it means <i>unbroken</i>. That is not how it feels to be conscious at all.

    <h2> Time disappeared </h2>

      Not too long ago I had surgery on my shoulder to repair an old injury. Twenty years earlier, on a very English summer's day, I took a tumble down the side of the Iron Age hill fort known as Maiden Castle. Arms flailing, sheep watching with no more concern than the little fluffy clouds I watched, on my back at the bottom of the fosse, once I had come to a painful stop. I like to think this is a more picturesque than average reason to require shoulder stabilization. The surgery took place at a clinic in San Francisco, and I remember waiting anxiously, heart rate too high, as the anesthesiologist began the-- it was over. I was sitting in a different room, no sensation on my righthand side, being told my the nurse that the surgery had been a success. Are you sure it's already happened? I said. Several hours had disappeared as if excised by a scalpel.

      We exist in time, which can speed and slow and skip. You know this already: you will have experienced many more 4pms than 4ams.
