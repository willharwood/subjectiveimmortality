      <a href="introduction.html"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
      What is <i>Subjective immortality</i> (and the foolishness of <i>objective</i> immortality).
      The <i>common-sense view</i>, a materialist position from which we will not deviate.
      The belief in oblivion, and our first proof that it does not exist, which rests on arguments against the need for strict continuity.
      Implications of not needing continuity: exactly <i>what</i> is immortal? Towards the Bundled Dichotomy: experience is either momentary, or eternal. <i>Anattā</i>.
      Another, weirder, far more difficult way in we are subjectively immortal.
      
      <a href="history.html"><h3>Chapter 1: History</h3></a>
      The deep history of materialism and of subjective immortality. The pre-Socratics (Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Empedocles, and others), then Epicurus.
      Lucretius and <i>De rerum Natura</i>: his proof against the fear of death, the two questions ("what was it like before you were born", "what will it be like after you have died") that he answers with <i>oblivion</i>. Its rediscovery and role in the Renaissance, which has Michel de Montaigne write a surprisingly modern question in his copy. Hobbes and the Ship of Theseus (and "A great leap in the dark"). Hume and his Bundle theories of consciousness. Nietzsche, and the <i>eternal return</i>. Boltzmann, who arrived at a similar idea via thermodynamics.
      Parfit, and the Nonidentity Problem.

      <a href="consciousness.html"><h3>Chapter 2: Theories of consciousness</h3></a>
      Current theories of consciousness. The hard problem, and the many ways it is avoided.
      Why materialism does not remove free will (for a certain value of free will).
      Panpsychism and its deficiencies. The impossibility of philosophical zombies.

      <a href="continuities.html"><h3>Chapter 3: The continuity of consciousness</h3></a>
      The subjective continuity of consciousness, even as objective discontinuities abound.
      Easy arguments: the discontinuity of life and death can be batted away,
      more difficult is the discontinuity of matter. <i>Transporter arguments</i>.
      Build on two threads: that materialism implies the subjective immortality of "you";
      and that the same arguments threaten the very continuity of an entity we call "you" (leads directly to <a href="bundles.html">Chapter 5: Hume meets the Buddha</a>).

      <a href="future.html"><h3>Chapter 4: The far future</h3></a>
      What if the future is not infinite? Reasons to think it is both infinite and infinitely interesting.
      The past: what if that were infinite too? Boltzmann Brains.

      <a href="bundles.html"><h3>Chapter 5: Hume meets the Buddha</h3></a>
      Bundled theories of consciousness, the illusion of the self.
      The Buddhist concept of <i>Anattā</i>.
      Memory as the way to simulate continuity, and why it should be difficult to believe that the illusion is an illusion. Experience without an experiencer.
      The Bundled Dichotomy.

      <a href="unknowns.html"><h3>Chapter 6: Conclusions and future work</h3></a>
      Keep us honest, highlight the gaps.
      Do arguments based on static patterns work when consciousness is a fundamentally dynamic experince?
      Have we dismissed physical continuity too easily?
      And if it is true (and it <i>is</i> either true or false, this is not an academic exercise, it is a genuine attempt at discovering the nature of subjective experience), what changes? A solution to Parfit's Nonidentity Problem (one that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion). The foolishness of cruelty. The fear of death.
