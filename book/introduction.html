	When Dawn asked Zeus to make her lover Tithonus immortal, she forgot to ask for eternal youth. He aged, "here at the quiet limit of the world", envious "of happy men that have the power to die, and grassy barrows of the happier dead" in Tennyson's telling, and lives still, withered into a cicada that cannot sleep. Immortality is one of those things we all have in common: from the richest to the poorest, none of us have it, and attempts to achieve it are sad or comical. The first emperor of China sent teams to the far corners of the world in search of elixirs of eternal life, and then died of mercury poisoning after eating the results. Cryonics, the practice of freezing the head or body of the recently deceased in the hope of reviving them in the distant future, once the cure for having your head cut off and filled with antifreeze is found, takes wishful thinking into the realms of myth, and adds a barrel of predatory capitalism. Some creatures are said to be <i>biologically</i> immortal, meaning that they do not age, or can see-saw between younger and older forms. That the chances of death do not <i>increase</i> with age is less helpful than one might think, when the chances of death are high to begin with at any age.

	How to explain amongst our current crop of plutocrats the lack of interest in a legacy? There are no modern Carnegie Libraries, no new Nobel Prize worth the name, the Guggenheim Museum has no competition from any tech billionaire. It is not mere philistinism, it is because many believe that they will, personally, live forever; and, richer than the emperor of China, they are ploughing funds into making it a reality. We can wait and see how that turns out (or, not, given that none of us are immortal). Betting on disappointment has never failed in the history of eucaryotic life. But such objective immortality is not what this book is about. We are interested in a different sort of immortality, not of a single body sailing through time like an Egyptian mummy; instead, an immortality of experience, of feeling; immortality as the opposite of oblivion.
