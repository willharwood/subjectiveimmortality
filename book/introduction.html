      <h1> Introduction </h1>

      <p class="first">
	When Dawn asked Zeus to make her lover Tithonus immortal, she forgot to ask for eternal youth. He aged, "here at the quiet limit of the world", envious "of happy men that have the power to die" in Tennyson's telling, and lives still, withered into a cicada that can barely call and cannot sleep. Immortality is one of those things we all have in common: from the richest to the poorest, none of us have it, and attempts to achieve it are sad or comical. The first emperor of China sent teams to the far corners of the world in search of elixirs of eternal life, and then died of mercury poisoning after consuming the results. Cryonics, the practice of freezing the head or body of the recently deceased in the hope of reviving them in the distant future, once the cure for having your head cut off and filled with antifreeze is found, takes wishful thinking into the realms of myth, and adds a barrel of predatory capitalism. Some creatures are said to be <i>biologically</i> immortal, meaning that they do not age, or can see-saw between younger and older forms. That the chances of death do not increase with age is less helpful than one might think, when the chances of death are high to begin with at any age.

	How to explain amongst our current crop of plutocrats the lack of interest in an artistic or cultural legacy? There are no modern Carnegie Libraries, no new Nobel Prize worth the name, the Guggenheim Museum has no competition from any tech billionaire. It is not mere philistinism, it is because many believe that they will, personally, live forever; and, richer than the emperor of China, they are ploughing funds into making it a reality. We can wait and see how that turns out (or not, given that none of us are immortal). Betting on disappointment has never failed in the history of eucaryotic life. But such objective immortality is not what this book is about. We are interested in a different sort of immortality, not of a single body lurching through time like a Nineteenth Dynasty mummy; instead, an immortality of experience, of feeling, immortality as the opposite of oblivion.

	You are currently experiencing reading this sentence, as part of a melange of other experiences. Perhaps music is playing, there are voices in another room. You are the locus of sensation, the <i>there</i> of something being there. One moment, and then the next. We have to believe, when looking at another person, looking back at us, that there too is a unique view on the universe. It is easy to believe this of some animals, it is not a matter of language. Who could observe an orangutan and not believe that the orangutan is observing back? Pets too, with less thought yet no less feeling. It need not be a matter of intelligence, per se; or rather, the boundary between conscious and non-conscious might be very far down. It seems likely that a nervous system is a prerequisite, though panpsycist theories would quibble there. For a plant to be conscious would seem a waste. For an ant though, simple and rule-following? To watch an ant pause to clean itself, to consider its senses, what it sees and smells, is to pause ourselves.

	Experience is not a continuous thing, dreamless sleep and other forms of unconsciousness punctuate our days. We skip through time to the next conscious moment. Those who strive for objective immortality believe that without it, these experiences must end. It is a reasonable belief, albeit one that is historically unusual. To picture an eternity of oblivion is like imagining an absense, not a dark corner or black space, a true absense. Oblivion can be named, talked and reasoned about, but not pictured. What is it like not to be? It is a historically unusual belief because much of the brocade of religion exists to deny it. There is this world, and the next; there is something apart from the physical, which has the ability to survive, and moreover, whatever the mirror says, is closer to the true you. For several reasons we will not consider this option. Once you admit the supernatural, what can really be said? And I do not think it is true. I can be clear that this is just as much a belief as any other, based on my partial view and life-so-far and a sincere attempt to keep some rigour. I think, on the balance of probabilities, that the universe is random, what meaning there is is the meaning we try to give it (and we do have to try), that life itself is a sort of miracle of improbability, conscious life doubley so. There is the physical world, of forces and matter, and the fact that certain collections of matter, at certain times, <i>experience the universe</i> is a true mystery, perhaps never to be solved. The biggest fact that there is.

	There is another reason why, in this book, we will stick to a physicalist view, atoms in motion and nothing else. And that is because <i>in</i> being consistent here, we can arrive at some startling conclusions. Conclusions that look taken from a very different philosophy. That oblivion, in the sense we have been using it as the infinite stretch of nothing after the last conscious moment is had, does not exist. That there will never be a last conscious moment. That, even as objective immortality is a fool's errand, subjective immortality is real. Is inescapable, in fact. 
      </p>
      <p>
	Let us start at the end, and the real purpose of this book. It is to use the assumed fact of physicalism, and a number of thought experiments, to arrive at the following dichotomy, that exactly one of the following two statements must be true:
      </p>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Subjective experience never ends, there is no such thing as oblivion. This is a sort of immortality.</li>
	  <li> Subjective experience is a momentary phenomenon. Not only is oblivion real, it is what we experience in the very next moment after this.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
	<i>Either</i> we are subjectively immortal, <i>or</i> we do not even have subjective continuity from one moment to the next. Experience is forever or for a single moment, with no option in between. Those trying to endlessly extend the lives of their bodies have missed the point in the most profound way one can imagine.
