	When Dawn asked Zeus to make her lover Tithonus immortal, she forgot to ask for eternal youth. He aged, "here at the quiet limit of the world", envious "of happy men that have the power to die, and grassy barrows of the happier dead" in Tennyson's telling, and lives still, withered into a cicada that cannot sleep. Immortality is one of those things we all have in common: from the richest to the poorest, none of us have it, and attempts to achieve it are sad or comical. The first emperor of China sent teams to the far corners of the world in search of elixirs of eternal life, and then died of mercury poisoning after eating the results. Cryonics, the practice of freezing the head or body of the recently deceased in the hope of reviving them in the distant future, once the cure for having your head cut off and filled with antifreeze is found, takes wishful thinking into the realms of myth, and adds a barrel of predatory capitalism. Some creatures are said to be <i>biologically</i> immortal, meaning that they do not age, or can see-saw between younger and older forms. That the chances of death do not <i>increase</i> with age is less helpful than one might think, when the chances of death are high to begin with at any age.

	How to explain amongst our current crop of plutocrats the lack of interest in an artistic or cultural legacy? There are no modern Carnegie Libraries, no new Nobel Prize worth the name, the Guggenheim Museum has no competition from any tech billionaire. It is not mere philistinism, it is because many believe that they will, personally, live forever; and, richer than the emperor of China, they are ploughing funds into making it a reality. We can wait and see how that turns out (or, not, given that none of us are immortal). Betting on disappointment has never failed in the history of eucaryotic life. But such objective immortality is not what this book is about. We are interested in a different sort of immortality, not of a single body lurching through time like a Nineteenth Dynasty mummy; instead, an immortality of experience, of feeling; immortality as the opposite of oblivion.

	You are currently experiencing reading this sentence, as part of a melange of other experiences. Perhaps music is playing, there are voices in another room. You are the locus of sensation, the <i>there</i> of something being there. One moment, and then the next. We have to believe, when looking at another person, looking back at us, that there too is a unique view on the universe. It is easy to believe this of some animals, it is not a matter of language. Who could observe an orangutan and not believe that the orangutan is observing back? Pets too, with less thought yet no less feeling. It need not be a matter of intelligence, per se; or rather, the boundary between conscious and non-conscious might be very far down. It seems likely that a nervous system is a prerequisite, though panpsycist theories would quibble there. For a plant to be conscious would seem a waste. For an ant though, simple and rule-following? To watch an ant pause to clean itself, to consider its senses, of sight and smell, is to pause ourselves. Experience is not a continuous thing, dreamless sleep and other forms of unconsciousness punctuate our days. We skip through time to the next conscious moment.

	Those who strive for objective immortality believe that without it, these experiences must end. It is a reasonable belief, albeit one that is historically unusual. An eternity of oblivion is:
