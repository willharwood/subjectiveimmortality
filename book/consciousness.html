      <h1> Consciousness </h1>


      <h2> It's not what you think </h2>
      <p class="first">
	<i>Normal</i> is a poor guide to the nature of consciousness. That it must involve a sense of self, of self-protection, of rationality, of personal continuity, all are contradicted by one mental aberration or another. Those suffering from Cotard's Syndrome believe that they are dead; those with Anton syndrome are blind, yet convinced in a way that is immune to all evidence that they can see. When the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves that connects the hemispheres of the brain, is severed, a single consciousness collapses into two independent selfs, sharing a body, and yet each having no inner knowledge of the other. It is difficult to conjure a condition bizarre enough to have not been sufferered by someone. All are examples of subjective experience, and indeed might be the typical subjective experience of another animal. A loss of language brings us closer to the other great apes, in that one respect; each animal has its own balance of sense data. There is a good reason why a sense of self should be common: it fosters bodily integrity, which in turn makes it more likely that the genes <i>for</i> a sense of self will be replicated into the next generation. That does not mean it is fundamental, it can be an invention atop the underlying machinery of experience. Vision is a common subjective experience, but not a necessary one, it is possible to exist without sight (and have a subjective experience that is impossible for a sighted person to imagine, who can only picture black when asked to picture nothing at all). The sense of a single self, moving through time, may be <i>why</i> we are consious. It does not mean that it is not an illusion, generated moment-by-moment. The self never seems to be where we go looking for it. It is a machine whose workings only become apparent when they malfunction, and then, often only to someone else.
