      <h1> Consciousness </h1>


      <h2> It's not what you think </h2>
      <p class="first">
	<i>Normal</i> is a poor guide to the nature of consciousness. That it must involve a sense of self, of self-protection, of rationality, of personal continuity, all are contradicted by one mental aberration or another. Those suffering from Cotard's Syndrome believe that they are dead; those with Anton syndrome are blind, yet convinced in a way that is immune to all evidence that they can see. When the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves that connects the hemispheres of the brain, is severed, a single consciousness collapses into two independent selfs, sharing a body, and yet each having no inner knowledge of the other. It is difficult to conjure a condition bizarre enough to have not been sufferered by someone. All are examples of subjective experience, and indeed might be the typical subjective experience of another animal. A loss of language brings us closer to the other great apes, in that one respect; each animal has its own balance of sense data. There is a good reason why a sense of self should be common: it fosters bodily integrity, which in turn makes it more likely that the genes <i>for</i> a sense of self will be replicated into the next generation. That does not mean it is fundamental, it can be an invention atop the underlying machinery of experience. Vision is a common subjective experience, but not a necessary one, it is possible to exist without sight (and have a subjective experience that is impossible for a sighted person to imagine, who can only picture black when asked to picture nothing at all). The sense of a single self, moving through time, may be <i>why</i> we are consious. It does not mean that it is not an illusion, generated moment-by-moment. The self never seems to be where we go looking for it. It is a machine whose workings only become apparent when they malfunction, and then, often only to someone else.

	Consciousness is the first problem and perhaps it will be the last.

      <h2> Three mysteries </h2>

      <p class="first">
	Consider three mysteries: life, intelligence, and consciousness. The mystery of <i>life</i> is how chemistry could become biology. How did it begin, in some deep sea vent or warm sheltered pond? What were the precursors of DNA, when did evolution begin? The mystery of <i>intelligence</i> is finding renewed interest today: are generative artificial intelligence models exhibiting true intelligence, or merely copying from training data vast enough to encompass every every-day task? Is that what intelligence is, in fact: finding structure in data, then applying it? Are we mere prediction machines too, or is there some qualitative difference between our intelligence and what is possible of a machine? And finally <i>consciousness</i>, whose mystery needs no examples.
      </p>
      <p>
	The mysteries of life and of intelligence are readily solveable. Not easily: it has taken human civilization almost until the present day to even pose the questions in ways that admit solutions. For life, there are plausible models of how, for example, submarine alkaline vents of the early Earth could have created cell-like structures and harboured life-like chemistry that birthed the precursors of bacteria and archaea. Experiments can be run, mathematical models constructed. It is possible that the emergence of life is so unlikely that we will have to imagine a trillion Earth-like planets before it becomes a possibility. An explanation that makes life's emergence almost inevitable would be easier to believe (and have worrying implications). Perhaps we will go to the moons of Jupiter or Saturn to look for evidence of a parallel creation. We will never know the precise moment or location of life's appearance on Earth, nor exactly what that first cell looked like, how long it lasted. But that is not necessary to feel that we have solved the mystery of life. We need a narrative of how, step by step, chemistry could become biology, one that makes testable hypothoses, and allows for its steps to be repeated, either in simulation or directly in a laboratory. And if the universe really is predisposed to life, we will, eventually, find it out there too; and if the path is so narrow that in most galaxies not a single planet will give rise to life, then as the centuries and millennia pass, the further we travel the more confident we will in saying: we are alone with ourselves. The mystery is in finding the right arrangement of pieces that we already have. It requires many small new ideas, yet no revolution in understanding. Those big ideas have already been had.
      </p>
      <p>
	And frequently, in the solution to the mystery of life, we will assert things like: carbon chemistry is such that it allows for vastly more complex molecules than can be constructed with other atoms as their base. Or, a proton gradient is built as a store of energy which is then used to power this or that reaction. One can go a step deeper, look at the electron structure of carbon atoms, say; deeper investigations in how semipermeable membranes of lipids interact with free hydrogen atoms. It is not necessary though, to feel satisfied. The properties of the physical universe are facts. Their own mysteries perhaps; you do not have to solve everything in order to solve one thing. That the physical world has certain predictable physical properties is easily given. We already live in a world of physical laws.
      </p>
      <p>
	Intelligence has similar properties as a problem, though is if anything more empirical. Is intelligence being able to win a game of chess? Yes -- until we managed to write computer programs which will reliably beat any human chess player who ever lived, and then no. As isolated human skills fall to software, we do get closer to an idea of that general intelligence might be. The ability to learn from just a few examples (not the entire Internet); to hold ideas, and combine them in novel ways; to have a memory that is, in a sense, alive. None of this necessarily requires consciousness, and it is plausible (and literally trillions of dollars are, as I write, riding on this proposition) that this decade we will have software systems which exceed any type of human intelligence we can, with our human intelligence, find. A neural net of sufficient scale, of the right sort of complexity? There need be nothing like to <i>be</i> that machine, no further mystery. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The mystery of consciousness is different. An active area of study is to find the neural correlates of consciousness: exactly those structures and signals that mean a brain is conscious. If one can see <i>this</i> synchronized wave across the brain at <i>this</i> frequency, the person is conscious; otherwise not. Create that situation, and you have created a conscious experience. The short term promise is to be able to tell whether, say, a person in a persistent vegetative state can in fact feel, locked inside their head; the long term promise is to be able to create new consciousness itself. It is Promethean, the ability to create life, intelligent life, conscious life.
