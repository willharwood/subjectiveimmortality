      <h1> Consciousness </h1>


      <h2> It's not what you think </h2>
      <p class="first">
	<i>Normal</i> is a poor guide to the nature of consciousness. That it must involve a sense of self, of self-protection, of rationality, of personal continuity, all are contradicted by one mental aberration or another. Those suffering from Cotard's Syndrome believe that they are dead; those with Anton syndrome are blind, yet convinced in a way that is immune to all evidence that they can see. When the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves that connects the hemispheres of the brain, is severed, there is evidence that the single consciousness collapses into two independent selfs, sharing a body, and yet each having no inner knowledge of the other. It is difficult to conjure a condition bizarre enough to have not been sufferered by someone.
